# The structural lints: the checks that state properties no compiler can.
#
# One target rather than a line per lint per gate. Before 2026-07-30 each lint
# was named in every target that wanted it, and the cost showed up immediately:
# `ci-full` invoked the purity gate twice (once directly, once through
# batchalign-ci-rust), and `lint-wide-structs` reached only `ci-local`, which
# nobody runs, so its table drifted for two months. Adding a sixth lint is now
# one line here.
# The three CI hygiene jobs, each a NAMED TARGET so `ci.yml` can invoke it by
# name. That is the whole point: `scripts/check_push_gate_sync.py` exists to
# fail when the pre-push hook does not run everything CI runs, but it can only
# see CI steps written as `make <target>`. These three jobs used to be raw
# commands, so the intersection it computes was EMPTY and it compared `ci.yml`
# against nothing and printed success -- which is exactly how an unformatted
# commit reached CI on 2026-08-25 in a repo that already owns an anti-drift
# checker. Naming them puts them under that check mechanically, instead of
# under a hand-written mirror somebody has to remember to update.

# Layer 1 CI gate. Catalog-independent, walks every .md file under the
# repo root and exits non-zero if any high-severity prose-reference
# pattern (deleted crate, moved book path) is found outside the
# allow-list. Designed for ci.yml use where audit.db is not present.
