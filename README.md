The unified home for the [TalkBank](https://talkbank.org/) toolchain.
Four user-facing products ship from this repo, all centered on the
CHAT transcript format:

- **Batchalign3** — audio/ML pipeline that produces and enriches CHAT
  (transcribe, align, morphotag, translate, segment).
- **`chatter`** — CHAT-first command-line tool for validation,
  normalization, conversion, and CLAN-compatible analysis.
- **VS Code extension** — interactive editor for CHAT files with
  live validation and rich navigation.
- **CLAN command reference** — a Rust reimplementation of CLAN's
  analysis, transform, and converter commands, accessible through
  `chatter clan ...`.

Plus the supporting library surface: the public Rust crates for
parsing/validation/transform, the `talkbank-lsp` language server,
the `tree-sitter-talkbank` grammar, the Batchalign Python package,
the PyO3 bridge, and two experimental desktop apps.

## Main products

### Batchalign3 — audio + ML CHAT pipeline

The audio/ML-facing CLI for transcription, forced alignment,
morphotagging, utterance segmentation, translation, and benchmarking.

```bash
batchalign3 transcribe recordings/ -o transcripts/ --lang eng
batchalign3 align corpus/ -o aligned/
batchalign3 morphotag corpus/ -o tagged/
```

Public preview product line on the `0.1.x` release. The canonical
public install path is PyPI via `uv`:

```bash
uv tool install batchalign3
```

See the [Batchalign3 Installation guide](book/src/batchalign/user-guide/installation.md)
and [Quickstart](book/src/batchalign/user-guide/quick-start.md) for
first-run details.

### `chatter` — CHAT-first CLI

The command-line tool for everything CHAT-text:

- validation
- normalization / linting
- CHAT ↔ JSON conversion
- CLAN-compatible analysis, transforms, and format converters

```bash
chatter validate transcript.cha
chatter clan freq corpus/
chatter to-json transcript.cha -o transcript.json
```

See the [`chatter` Installation guide](book/src/chatter/user-guide/installation.md),
[CLI reference](book/src/chatter/user-guide/cli-reference.md), and
[CLAN command reference](book/src/clan-reference/introduction.md).

### VS Code extension — interactive CHAT editor

Live syntax highlighting, validation, code-completion, cross-tier
navigation, dependency graphs, and review/coder workflows. VSIX
bundles ship from GitHub Releases.

See [vscode/README.md](vscode/README.md) and the
[VS Code extension Getting Started](book/src/vscode/getting-started/installation.md).

## Surface status at a glance

| Surface | What first-time users should assume today |
|---|---|
| Batchalign3 CLI / server / dashboard | Public preview Batchalign product surface for audio/ML workflows |
| `chatter` CLI | Stable public CHAT-first command-line surface; strongest current support story |
| Public Rust core crates | Stable public source-level integration surface for CHAT parsing/validation |
| `talkbank-lsp` + VS Code extension | Public preview editor surface; GitHub Releases publish platform-specific VSIX bundles |
| `tree-sitter-talkbank` grammar | Public preview reusable grammar surface |
| `apps/dashboard-desktop/` (Batchalign Desktop) | Experimental Batchalign GUI shell only; not a supported release surface |
| `apps/chatter-desktop/` (Chatter Desktop) | Experimental validation GUI only; not a supported release surface |

## Documentation

All user, developer, and architecture docs live in **one** mdBook:
[`book/`](book/) — the **TalkBank Toolchain** book. It absorbs four
previously-separate sub-books (chatter, Batchalign3, VS Code,
CLAN command reference) into one tree organized by audience-first
sections under `book/src/`.

| Section | What lives there | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| Front matter | What is this, install hub, choose-your-path quickstart | [Introduction](book/src/introduction.md), [Install](book/src/install/index.md), [Quickstart](book/src/quickstart/index.md) |
| `book/src/batchalign/` | Batchalign3: migration from BA2, user guide, architecture, technical reference, developer guide, design decisions | [Batchalign3 introduction](book/src/batchalign/introduction.md) |
| `book/src/chatter/` | `chatter` CLI: user guide, integration | [`chatter` introduction (book root)](book/src/introduction.md) |
| `book/src/chat-format/` | The CHAT format reference: headers, utterances, retraces, replacements, dependent tiers, symbols | [CHAT format overview](book/src/chat-format/overview.md) |
| `book/src/vscode/` | VS Code extension: getting started, editing, navigation, media, analysis, review, coder, workflows, configuration, troubleshooting, developer guide | [VS Code Getting Started](book/src/vscode/getting-started/installation.md) |
| `book/src/clan-reference/` | CLAN command reference: per-command pages for the analysis, transform, and converter families | [CLAN command reference introduction](book/src/clan-reference/introduction.md) |
| `book/src/architecture/` | Architecture and parser/grammar/data-model design | [Architecture overview](book/src/architecture/overview.md) |
| `book/src/contributing/` | Contributor workflows, testing, coding standards, dev checks | [Contributing Setup](book/src/contributing/setup.md) |

Build the book locally:

```bash
make book
make book-serve   # opens http://localhost:3000

Repo-level release-contract policy documents live at
[`docs/`](docs/) (entry point: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)) —
platform support matrix, release contract, versioning policy, and
the auto-generated error catalog under `docs/errors/`.

## Installing and building

### Install `chatter` / `talkbank-lsp` from source

```bash
cargo install --path crates/talkbank-cli
cargo install --path crates/talkbank-lsp
```

### Install `batchalign3`

```bash
uv tool install batchalign3
```

Repo-hosted `.command`/`.bat` helper scripts under
[`installers/`](installers/README.md) wrap the same `uv tool install
batchalign3` flow; they are not a separate signed installer channel.

### Common developer commands

```bash
make help                  # overview of repo-native tasks
make check                 # core compile checks
make test                  # core Rust tests + doctests + spec tools
make verify                # canonical core pre-merge gate
make batchalign-check      # imported Batchalign compile checks
make batchalign-test-rust  # imported Batchalign Rust library suites
make batchalign-test-integration
make batchalign-dashboard-build
make batchalign-build-wheel
make book                  # build the unified TalkBank Toolchain mdBook
make ci-local              # fast local CI approximation
make ci-full               # stricter local CI approximation
```

For lower-level build helpers:

```bash
cargo run -q -p xtask -- help
```
