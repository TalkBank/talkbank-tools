"""Strip neural-LM control tokens from Stanza Document output.

Upstream Stanza pipelines occasionally leak character language model
control tokens (``<SOS>``, ``<EOS>``, ``<UNK>``, ``<PAD>``, ``<s>``,
``</s>``) into the public ``Document`` API's ``text`` and ``lemma``
fields. The known case is Finnish MWT splitting of ``tollei`` in a
3+-word context on Stanza 1.11.1 — see
``batchalign/tests/pipelines/morphosyntax/test_stanza_fi_mwt_sos_leak.py``
for the minimal reproducer and
``book/src/reference/stanza-limitations.md`` for the defect-registry
entry (look up by the slug ``stanza-fi-mwt-sos-leak``; the registry's
numeric "Defect N" labels can renumber as entries are retired).

The workaround follows the project's documented upstream-defect
policy (``book/src/developer/upstream-defect-policy.md``): detect the
known upstream defect, rewrite to produce coherent output, log the
rewrite so it's visible in ops monitoring, and let ``chatter
validate`` catch anything we missed. Specifically: strip the
control-token substring from ``text`` and ``lemma`` fields, return
the stripped leaks so callers can log them with filename/language
context.

This is not silent swallowing — the workaround is registered, logged,
and has permanent regression tests. If Stanza fixes the leak upstream,
the detector's preconditions never fire and we retire the workaround.

A parallel-but-currently-unused validator
``UdWord._sanitize_pad_deprel`` in ``morphosyntax.py`` handles the
same defect class for the ``deprel`` field via Pydantic. That
validator is only exercised by tests today; the production
``batch_infer_morphosyntax`` does not pipe Stanza output through
``UdWord``. If a future refactor wires ``UdWord`` into the
production path, consolidate the two sanitizers there.
