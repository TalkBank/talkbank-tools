"""Typed classification of Hugging Face Hub access/credential failures.

A pinned model artifact can fail to download for reasons that are a
configuration problem on the OPERATOR's machine, not a defect in batchalign:
the artifact's repository requires accepting license terms, the operator has
no Hub token, the token lacks access, or the Hub is unreachable and no cached
copy exists. Left unclassified, that failure surfaces at the worker boundary
as an undifferentiated runtime crash, which the server reports as a
generic/validation-class failure and the dashboard renders as "pipeline bug"
even though nothing about batchalign itself is broken.

:func:`classify_huggingface_access_error` maps the specific
``huggingface_hub`` exception CLASSES raised for those cases (never their
free-form message text, which can be reworded between releases without
notice) into one typed :class:`ModelAccessDeniedError`. A caller that catches
this exception, rather than the underlying Hub exception, gets a stable
identity the Rust worker boundary can recognize via
``pyo3::import_exception!`` without inspecting anything huggingface_hub owns.
