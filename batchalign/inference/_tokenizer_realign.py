"""Tokenizer realignment for tokenize_no_ssplit mode.

When Stanza's neural tokenizer runs (``tokenize_no_ssplit=True``), it may
split compound words like "ice-cream" into multiple tokens ("ice", "-",
"cream").  This module provides a ``tokenize_postprocessor`` callback that
merges such spurious splits back, preserving the 1:1 mapping between CHAT
words and Stanza tokens.

MWT hints (True/False tuples)
------------------------------
Stanza's ``tokenize_postprocessor`` uses a tuple convention::

    (text, True): MWT: let the MWT processor expand (e.g. "don't" → do + n't)
    (text, False), NOT an MWT: suppress expansion (e.g. merged "ice-cream")
    plain string: let Stanza's model decide (equivalent to model's own choice)

This module replicates Python master's ``tokenizer_processor`` logic:

* **Default (all languages)**: merged spurious splits → ``(text, False)``
  Prevents a merge like "ice-cream" from being expanded again by the MWT model.
* **English contractions**: merged text that contains ``'``, *unless* the
  prefix before the first ``'`` is ``"o"`` (e.g. o'clock, o'er) → ``(text, True)``
  Allows "don't", "Claus'" etc. to be handled by Stanza's MWT model.

This matches the Python master rules (``ud.py`` lines 680-685) exactly.

Thread safety: :class:`TokenizerContext` uses ``threading.local()`` to store
``original_words`` per-thread.  On free-threaded Python (3.14t+), multiple
threads can call ``nlp()`` concurrently without racing on the context.  On
regular Python, the ``nlp_lock`` in the batch callback still serializes
access, so the thread-local is effectively a single-thread property.

    MWT hint preservation
    ---------------------
    Stanza's tokenizer natively emits ``(text, True)`` tuples for tokens
    it wants its MWT processor to expand (English contractions, French
    elisions, etc.). The Rust ``align_tokens`` function operates on raw
    strings for its char-DP algorithm, so tuple hints are temporarily
    erased when we flatten. When no merging actually happened (1:1
    mapping between Stanza tokens and the aligner's output), we overlay
    Stanza's original tuples back onto the aligned output so MWT
    expansion still fires downstream. Without this overlay, Stanza's MWT
    processor sees only plain strings and silently skips expansion, the
    direct cause of the 2026-04-13 Preserve-mode regression.
