"""Forced-alignment confirmation verify engine: does the placed text align?

One of the three placement-verification engines behind `merge-verify`
(with pitch banding and the machine ear). Aligns a placed utterance's
words against the audio window around its bullet span with the
torchaudio MMS_FA bundle and reports the mean/min per-word alignment
score.

CALIBRATION-LOCKED: every constant here (sample rate, window padding
and bounds, the star-token model variant, CPU inference, the word
normalization alphabet) matches the pipeline that was human-calibrated
in July 2026. Changing any of them, or substituting a different
aligner, invalidates that calibration; recalibrate against blind
listening verdicts before shipping such a change.

THE SCORE IS ORDERING-ONLY, NEVER A GATE. Calibration measured that
low FA score does not mean wrong placement (11/18 sampled FA-fail
lines were correctly placed: disfluent child speech aligns poorly) and
high FA score does not mean right placement (0.94 measured on pure
adult speech: the aligner happily aligns the wrong voice). The score
orders the human review queue worst-first; the promote/demote decision
belongs to the composed rule (pitch band + machine ear).
