"""Long-audio chunking and runaway detection for the native Qwen3-ASR engine.

Two jobs that the ``qwen-asr`` sidecar used to do for us, and that we own now
that BA3 drives ``transformers``' ``qwen3_asr`` module directly.

**Chunking.** The native path has no long-audio handling of its own: a whole
session fed to it does not merely score worse, it does not complete. This is a
port of the sidecar's ``split_audio_into_chunks``, which cuts at the quietest
window near each target boundary so a chunk edge lands in silence rather than
mid-word. Keeping the same algorithm is deliberate: the migration was decided
on a CER differential measured under this exact chunking, so changing it here
would invalidate the evidence that justified the change.

**Coordinate spaces.** The forced aligner returns times relative to THE AUDIO
IT WAS GIVEN, which under chunking is a 180-second window, not the recording.
Turning one into the other is a single addition that is invisible when omitted
and produces timings that look entirely reasonable until they land past the end
of the file. That has happened here before: FA emitted word timings 28.2
seconds past the end of their own audio on 6 of 226 sessions and went unnoticed
for two months. So the two spaces are named apart, and ``AudioChunk.to_file``
is the only conversion between them.

**Runaway detection.** Greedy decoding on this model can fall into a repetition
loop and emit until it hits the token cap. Measured on the 18-fixture Cantonese
benchmark: one chunk produced 4,584 characters for 179.6 seconds of audio while
every other chunk in the corpus stayed under 4.4 characters per second. A
silent hallucination of that size is worse than a crash, because nothing
downstream can tell it from speech.

**Decode budgeting.** A flat ``max_new_tokens`` cap sized for the longest
possible chunk, with no wall-clock stop, means a short chunk is decoded
against a budget it never needed and a repetition loop pays the FULL cost of
that cap before anything downstream looks at what it produced. Measured on a
fleet host (CPU, float32): a 411 s file ran past its 1800 s job ceiling
twice, driven by chunks decoded exactly this way. ``ChunkDecodeBudget`` is
built only from the ``AudioChunk`` it bounds, so a 10 s chunk and a 180 s
chunk are never decoded against the same numbers. Its outcome is typed too:
``ChunkDecodeOutcome`` is ``Bounded`` (the token cap or the deadline cut the
decode off before it stopped on its own) or ``Completed`` (it stopped on its
own, within budget), and ``detect_runaway`` reads that distinction first,
falling back to character density only for a ``Completed`` outcome.

**One owner of the file's time budget.** A per-chunk deadline computed
independently from ``chunk.seconds`` alone has no relationship to any ceiling
on the FILE as a whole; a file split into many chunks could accumulate an
unbounded total wall-clock spend even though each individual chunk looked
disciplined. ``DecodeBudget`` is built exactly ONCE per request, from the
file's total audio seconds and the same realtime factor
``ChunkDecodeBudget`` uses, and every chunk's deadline is drawn down from it
via ``ChunkDecodeBudget.for_chunk(chunk, remaining)``: a chunk's deadline is
the smaller of its own proportional share and whatever is left after the
chunks before it, so the SUM of every chunk's deadline can never exceed the
budget it was drawn from.

**Transport ceiling.** ``DecodeBudget`` bounds decode time only. The outer
transport/job-level timeout that carries a request end-to-end (audio load,
every chunk's decode and alignment, IPC) must be configured to at least this
budget PLUS a margin for that surrounding work, or the two ceilings can
disagree exactly the way the flat 1800 s job ceiling and the flat per-chunk
token cap disagreed in the reported defect. The Rust side of the job
pipeline is being changed to derive its own timeout from the SAME audio
duration this module uses, via a ``decode_budget_seconds`` field the request
will carry, so the two ceilings are computed from one duration instead of
drifting apart.
