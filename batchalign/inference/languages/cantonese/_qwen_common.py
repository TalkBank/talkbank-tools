"""Qwen3-ASR helpers for the built-in Cantonese engine.

Wraps the ``qwen-asr`` PyPI package. Mirrors the
``_funaudio_common.FunAudioRecognizer`` shape so the worker
bootstrap can swap engines uniformly. The actual model load is
deferred until first inference call — keeps worker startup time
bounded when no Qwen jobs are dispatched to the worker.

Engine selection rationale: Qwen3-ASR is an open-weight
Cantonese-capable ASR model from Alibaba. External evaluations on
per-utterance Cantonese child speech report competitive CER
relative to the major cloud APIs and to Cantonese-finetuned Whisper
variants; it is wired here as one engine option among several.

Device default is ``cpu``. Apple Silicon hosts have no CUDA, and
empirical testing found that MPS-backed inference produces degraded
output on the 1.7B model (the upstream ``transformers`` MPS path
isn't fully supported for Qwen3 attention ops yet). Hosts with CUDA
can opt in via ``engine_overrides["qwen_device"]="cuda"``.
