"""Qwen3-ASR helpers for the built-in Cantonese engine.

Drives ``transformers``' native ``qwen3_asr`` module directly. Mirrors the
``_funaudio_common.FunAudioRecognizer`` shape so the worker bootstrap can swap
engines uniformly. The actual model load is deferred until first inference
call, which keeps worker startup bounded when no Qwen jobs are dispatched.

Engine selection rationale: Qwen3-ASR is an open-weight Cantonese-capable ASR
model from Alibaba. It is wired here as one engine option among several.

**Why this no longer uses the ``qwen-asr`` package.** That package declared
``transformers==4.57.6``, an exact pin, and it was the single dependency
holding the whole project on the last 4.x release, which in turn blocked the
calibrated AudioFlamingo3 model in ``machine_ear``. Upstream ``transformers``
implements these same checkpoints natively as of 5.13.0, so the pin is
avoidable rather than negotiable. The swap was gated on a CER differential over
all 18 fixtures of the Cantonese benchmark, not on the test suite, because the
failure mode of an engine change is a quality regression that imports cleanly
and passes everything. That differential put the native path ahead on 15 of 18
fixtures and ahead on every CHILDES fixture. Two things it also turned up are
handled in ``_qwen_chunking``: the package's real value-add was long-audio
chunking, which we now own, and greedy decoding can run away into repetition,
which we now detect.

Device default is ``cpu``. Apple Silicon hosts have no CUDA, and MPS is not
usable for this model here: long audio is SIGKILLed with no exception and no
crash report, and float16 on MPS segfaults at load. Hosts with CUDA can opt in
via ``engine_overrides["qwen_device"]="cuda"``.
