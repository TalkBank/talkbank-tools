    The closed set, mirroring `talkbank_model::Terminator`'s CHAT surface
    forms, which is what the Rust side serializes at the IPC boundary. Naming
    each member keeps the vocabulary visible: a reader here sees that CHAT has
    thirteen ways to end an utterance, not that "the terminator is a string".

    Membership is enforced by parsing, so an unrecognized terminator fails the
    item's validation rather than travelling on as an unknown token. That is
    not hypothetical: it immediately caught a fixture asserting a CJK full
    stop, which CHAT does not use and Rust cannot send.

    KNOWN DUPLICATION, and it is NOT blocked. This is the third in-repo copy
    of the vocabulary, after `talkbank_model::Terminator::try_from_chat_str`
    and `chat_punct_chars()` in `batchalign-transform/src/translate.rs`, which
    already enumerates all thirteen. The removal is entirely local: give the
    Rust side one list, declare it as the schema's closed set in place of
    `#[schemars(with = "String")]` on `MorphosyntaxBatchItem::terminator`, and
    let `scripts/generate_ipc_types.sh` emit this enum, as it already emits
    `AsrBackendV2` and friends. Not done here only because it reaches outside
    this change; it is a task, not an obstacle. A conformance test asserting
    the copies stay equal is deliberately NOT the answer: it would
