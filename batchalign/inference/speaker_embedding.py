"""Span-level speaker embedding over one prepared recording.

This module is the model host for the ``speaker_embedding`` worker task. It
does exactly one thing: given the whole prepared mono PCM view of a recording
and a list of frame spans within it, return one fixed-width acoustic vector per
span. It decides nothing. Similarity, thresholds and verdicts belong to the
Rust control plane, which owns postprocessing.

## Which model, and why no new download

The embedding model is the one the released local diarization backend already
pins: the ``embedding`` node of the graph in ``local_pyannote_model.json``,
fetched by exact Hub commit through the same pinned-artifact loader
``pyannote_local`` uses. Nothing new is downloaded and nothing new is pinned,
so the two features cannot drift onto different acoustic models.

It is loaded here as a STANDALONE embedding model rather than as part of a
diarization pipeline. That distinction is load-bearing: constructing
``pyannote.audio``'s ``SpeakerDiarization`` pipeline also pulls a PLDA
calibration artifact from a gated repository, which is why standalone
``diarize`` needs Hugging Face credentials. Embedding alone touches only the
pinned, publicly readable embedding repository, so this task runs on a machine
with no Hugging Face account at all. The gated-repository error path is still
wired, because a private mirror or a future pin could reintroduce one.

## The measured hazard this module exists to contain

Below its own minimum input length the pinned ONNX graph does not raise. It
returns a correctly shaped, correctly typed float32 vector whose every
component is NaN. Nothing downstream can tell that from a real embedding by
inspecting its type, and a NaN similarity compares false against any
threshold, so a too-short utterance would silently become "no match" rather
than "not measurable". The host therefore reads the model's own
``min_num_samples`` and returns a distinct outcome for a span below it,
carrying the length that was too short.
