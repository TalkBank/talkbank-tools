"""HuggingFace Whisper fine-tune ASR backend (engine: ``whisper_hub``).

Loads a Malayalam (or any other language) Whisper fine-tune from the
Hugging Face Hub by model_id, resolved from a per-language default table
(``batchalign.models.resolve``) or an explicit user override via
``--engine-overrides '{"asr":"whisper_hub","model_id":"owner/model"}'``.

Why a separate engine rather than overloading ``whisper``:

- Stock OpenAI Whisper checkpoints and community fine-tunes have
  different generation_config semantics. Fine-tunes pin
  ``language`` / ``task`` inside their generation_config; passing
  ``language=...`` / ``task="transcribe"`` on a fine-tune produces
  gibberish. Stock Whisper requires the opposite, it *needs* the
  language hint. Merging the two loaders into one engine would make
  every line of dispatch code branch on the checkpoint's shape.
- Opt-out is surgical: ``--asr-engine whisper`` and
  ``--asr-engine whisper_hub`` are two different knobs.
- Per-engine language-support / quality metadata is a per-variant
  concern and composes cleanly when the variants are separate.

Mechanics:

- Model_id resolution is pure: ``resolve_whisper_hub_model_id`` takes
  the language + engine_overrides and returns either a concrete HF
  model_id or raises ``WhisperHubModelNotFoundError``.
- Model loading delegates through ``batchalign.inference.asr.load_whisper_asr``
  with ``language="auto"`` so the existing ``gen_kwargs`` path skips
  the task/language force (which breaks fine-tunes). The returned
  handle is the same ``WhisperASRHandle`` used by stock Whisper, so
  the V2 inference boundary
  (``batchalign.inference.asr.infer_whisper_prepared_audio``) works
  without modification.
- Inference reuses the existing Whisper prepared-audio path. This
  module contributes no new inference function.
