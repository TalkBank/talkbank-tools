"""Change-aware test selection via colocated ``affects:`` metadata.

Phase C1 of the test-cost revamp. Instead of a central
``test-selection.toml`` that rots silently, each test file declares
the code paths it covers in its own header:

Python::

    # affects: batchalign/inference/morphosyntax.py
    # affects: crates/batchalign/src/nlp/**

Rust::

    // affects: crates/batchalign/src/retokenize/**

Patterns are gitignore-style (``**`` supported) and matched via
``pathspec``. A test file with no ``affects:`` lines is treated as
"runs always" — backward compatible, gradual adoption.

Design note — the opposite convention (a central file mapping dir →
test subset) was considered in the research plan. It was rejected
in the Plan-agent critique (2026-04-23): a central TOML rots
silently when new test files or code paths land, and the drift
is invisible to review. Colocated metadata lives or dies with the
test it annotates, so stale declarations surface when the test
itself is touched.
