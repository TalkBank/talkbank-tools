"""Drift-sentinel reporting (Phase G of the test-cost revamp).

Probes (``@pytest.mark.mwt_probe`` and ``@pytest.mark.decision_probe``)
are monitors, not tests. They pin Stanza's current tokenization /
normalization behavior so a library upgrade that shifts behavior
surfaces as a diff. A probe "failure" warrants adjudication at
leisure; it should never block a push or a merge.

This module consumes the Phase B test-history SQLite (one row per
test invocation) and summarizes the most recent probe-run outcomes
into a markdown report. The runner script writes the report into
``docs/investigations/drift-*.md`` and opens an issue when any
drift is present, but never returns a non-zero exit code to the
caller.

Deliberately independent of pytest's own reporting machinery so a
crashed probe run (model failed to load, etc.) still produces a
report: the absence of expected rows in the DB is itself a
signal.
