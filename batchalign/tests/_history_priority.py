"""Historical-failure ordering for pytest (Phase E of the test-cost
revamp).

Reads the SQLite history written by Phase B's conftest hooks and
computes a per-test priority so the collection-modifyitems hook can
put likely-failing, fast-running tests at the front. Combined with
Phase A's interactive fail-fast, this produces failures within
seconds of running ``uv run pytest`` regardless of suite size.

Priority formula::

    fail_rate = fails / total_runs_last_N_days
    priority  = fail_rate / max(avg_duration_s, epsilon)

Why this shape:

* Fails fast-and-often → very high priority. The tests most likely
  to surface the next bug, amortized over the smallest wait.
* Fails slow-and-often → medium priority. Still worth running
  first, but a long-running test at the front can dominate
  perceived latency.
* Never fails recently → zero priority. Sort among themselves by
  collection order.
* No history at all → slightly-negative priority. A freshly-added
  test has no signal, so sort it AFTER the zero-fail-but-has-data
  bucket; running it alongside the healthy tail is the safe place.

Only reads ``framework = 'pytest'`` rows so Rust nextest data (when
it starts landing in the same DB) doesn't contaminate the Python
ordering.
