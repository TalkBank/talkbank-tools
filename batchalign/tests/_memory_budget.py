"""Memory-budget parallelism for pytest xdist.

Phase D of the test-cost revamp. Mirrors the constants in
``scripts/choose-test-concurrency.sh`` (used for ad-hoc nextest
invocations) so pytest and cargo-nextest share one mental model of
"how many of these can I run at once."

The previous policy was a binary cliff: if system RAM was below 128
GB, the OOM guard forced ``-n 0`` for any run containing golden
tests. Graduated parallelism replaces that cliff with budgeted
arithmetic:

    usable_mb = total_mb × (1 − reserve_fraction)
    jobs      = usable_mb // peak_rss_mb(profile)

The hard refusal behavior is preserved for hosts so small the
computed jobs count drops to zero, the caller forces serial
execution and warns.

Profile peak-RSS values are empirical estimates, not contractual
budgets. Update them when Phase B measurements show drift.
