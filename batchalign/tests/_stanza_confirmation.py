"""Which Stanza versions our documented behaviour has actually been confirmed on.

The defect-mitigation map carries a "Stanza version confirmed" column, and
several modules repeat a version in prose ("verified against stanza 1.13.0 on
...", "13k verb surface forms on stanza 1.13.0"). Every one of those is a claim
about a version that nothing compares against the version actually installed, so
bumping Stanza silently inherits every confirmation ever recorded.

That cost real time on 2026-07-31. Bumping to 1.14.0 produced two golden
failures, and there was no way to tell from the run which were caused by the
bump and which predated it, because no baseline was attached to anything. One
turned out to be a genuine 1.14.0 regression and the other had been failing
under 1.13.0 already. Distinguishing them needed a manual downgrade-and-rerun
that the version set below now makes unnecessary.

The rule was already written down. Writing it down is what failed. A frozen set
plus one test means an unconfirmed version announces itself instead of being
assumed fine.
