"""Per-test duration + outcome history store.

Phase B2 of the test-cost revamp. A thin SQLite wrapper the pytest
conftest feeds from ``pytest_runtest_logreport``; nextest can feed
it in a second pass by parsing its JSON message stream. One row per
test invocation: deliberately denormalized so queries for
historical-failure-ordering (Phase E) and top-N slowest tests
(Phase B3) stay one ``SELECT`` away.

Layered on top of ``scripts/test-bg.sh`` so background runs also
contribute data (see ``conftest.py::pytest_runtest_logreport`` for
the wiring).

Rationale for SQLite vs flat JSONL: we need range + aggregation
queries for Phase E ordering; SQLite is the simplest engine that
gives us ``WHERE ts > ? AND test_id = ?`` with an index. At ~1 KB
per row and a few thousand tests per day, the DB stays small for
years. If it ever grows past ~1 GB, ``DELETE FROM test_runs WHERE
ts < ?`` is a one-liner for rotation.
