"""Contract test for morphotag tokenizer realignment (Wave 3).

The morphotag pipeline's 1-to-1 invariant, that Stanza returns exactly N
tokens for N CHAT words after tokenizer realignment, depends on
``batch_infer_morphosyntax`` setting ``tok_ctx.original_words`` to the
batch's word lists BEFORE invoking ``nlp()``. If that sequencing breaks
(e.g. a refactor moves the assignment after the call, or a new branch
skips the assignment for non-retok mode), Stanza's neural tokenizer
runs without realignment and the invariant is silently violated.

This test locks the contract using a fake NLP callable that records what
``tok_ctx.original_words`` held at the moment it was invoked. The real
behavior we are testing lives in
``batchalign/inference/morphosyntax.py::batch_infer_morphosyntax``
around lines 343-378 (the ``should_set_original_words`` block).

See ``book/src/architecture/morphotag-invariants.md`` for the
architectural rationale.
