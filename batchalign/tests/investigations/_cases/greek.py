"""Greek probe cases (Tier B second batch, 2026-04-23).

Modern Greek under our with-postprocessor pipeline: all cases
1-to-1. Observation (2026-04-23 first golden run) includes:

* ``σ'αυτό`` stays one UD word (apostrophe clitic doesn't split
  under postprocessor).
* Negation ``δεν``, future particle ``θα`` stay as their own
  tokens (they're already separate in input, no merging).
