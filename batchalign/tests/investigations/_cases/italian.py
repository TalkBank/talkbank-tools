"""Italian probe cases.

Covers:

* Clitic-article elisions (``l'ami``, ``l'amico``, ``l'opera``), the
  old ``MwtTaggedExact("l'") → SuppressMwt`` target. Strict 1-to-1.
* Preposition+clitic elisions (``dell'opera``, ``nell'anno``,
  ``sull'ora``, ``all'amore``): strict 1-to-1. The
  ``dell_opera_in_context`` case is xfail-pinned against Defect 6
  (POS-layer verb-clitic split on ``parla``).
* ``lei`` (3sg.f pronoun) and adjacent ``le`` + ``i``, the old
  ``le + i → lei`` merge target. Strict 1-to-1 in both the real-``lei``
  cases and the adjacent-``le i`` cases.
* Preposition+article natives (``al``, ``del``, ``nel``, ``sul``,
  ``della``): observe only; MWT Range reassembly design.
* Noun / adjective pseudo-verb observations
  (``arancione_noun_bogus_verb``, ``piccolo_adj_bogus_verb``,
  ``gomitolo_noun_bogus_verb``, ``divano_noun_bogus_verb``)
  corpus-audit-derived pins for Defect 6's non-verb subclass.
  Stanza spuriously analyzes these clitic-shaped nouns/adjectives
  as verb+enclitic compounds (``arancione → verb|arancio~pron|ne``
  with ``Part Past`` features), producing committed-corpus %mor
  content that is linguistically wrong. UD-level count mismatch
  xfails pin Stanza's current behavior.
* Real-corpus ``parla`` observations (``parla_3sg_storia_context``,
  ``parla_imperative_forte``, ``parla_imperative_piu_forte``)
  pulled verbatim from ita-only files under the CHILDES Italian
  Frogs/Italian-Roma subtree. Strict UD-level 1-to-1 with xfail marks
  pinning Stanza's POS/MWT misbehavior. The xfails are
  **Stanza-behavior observations** at the UD level, not `%mor`
  injection-failure indicators: the count invariant at
  ``|%mor items| == mor_alignable_word_count`` holds, Stage 3's
  ``assemble_mors`` collapses MWT Ranges into compound `%mor`
  entries. The defect is content quality; see the per-case
  ``XfailMark.reason`` for the specifics.

* Counterexample probes (``dammela_counterexample`` etc.)
  observation-only. Stanza produces the correct imperative+clitic
  analysis for bare compound utterances
  (``dammela → da/dare/VERB + me/me/PRON + la/la/PRON``), Stage 3
  serializes it as
  ``verb|dare-Inf-Ind-Imp-S2~pron|me-Prs-S1~pron|la-Prs-S3``, and
  any content-correction rule for Italian must preserve this shape.
