"""Spanish probe cases.

Baseline coverage for a language with NO per-language BA2 override
rules. Covers the two canonical preposition+article contractions
(``al = a + el``, ``del = de + el``).

2026-04-23 parity audit: locked at observed counts as Stanza-drift
sentinels. Context forms expand; the alone forms are postprocessor
1-to-1 sentinels. Downstream Rust-side Range reassembly collapses
these back to 1-to-1 for final CHAT output, so production parity
with BA2 is preserved.

2026-06-19 (Stanza 1.13.0 re-evaluation): the ``del_alone`` drift
sentinel fired. Isolated ``del`` no longer MWT-expands to 2 UD
words; it now stays 1-to-1 (observed ``[('del', 'ADP', 'del')]``),
matching ``al``. Verified identical on the deployed Stanza 1.12.2
and on 1.13.0, so the change predates 1.13.0 (it landed with the
1.12.1 Spanish updates). Zero production impact: final CHAT output
is 1-to-1 either way. Re-locked ``del_alone`` at the new observed
count (1).
