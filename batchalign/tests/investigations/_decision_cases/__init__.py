Sibling to :mod:`.._cases` (MWT cases). The Phase-2 landing point
is intentionally empty: Phase 3 will seed English cases, and other
languages will join later as their normalization programs come
online.

The registry is keyed by :class:`..._cases.LanguageKey` so decision
probes can reuse the existing Stanza pipeline fixtures keyed by the
same type, no parallel language-key system.
