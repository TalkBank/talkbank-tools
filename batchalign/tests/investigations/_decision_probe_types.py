"""Typed data model for Stanza normalization-decision probes.

Companion to :mod:`._probe_types` (MWT probes). Where the MWT family
asks "does Stanza tokenize this CHAT word sequence the way we
expect?", this module asks "does a proposed normalization rule X
change Stanza's morphotag output on the affected tokens, and in
which direction?"

Design (v2, 2026-04-23)
-----------------------
v2 replaces v1's per-word integer addressing with token-centric
addressing plus n-to-m :class:`TokenMapping` records. Motivation:
the first golden run (see
``docs/investigations/2026-04-23-stanza-decision-probe-findings.md``)
surfaced three limits of v1:

* **MWT expansion breaks integer indexing.** Stanza tokenizes
  ``i'll`` as one input token but expands to two UD words (``i``,
  ``will``). v1 addressed UD words by their position in the
  flattened ``doc.sentences[*].words`` list but case authors wrote
  indices against the input word list. For any case that hit an
  MWT-triggering word, the two diverged silently.
* **POS-only comparator misses semantic loss.** v1 compared only
  UPOS, so ``3.14`` → ``3`` reported NEUTRAL (both NUM) even though
  the number's value changed. v2 supports text-gold alongside
  POS-gold so semantic regressions surface.
* **No n-to-m alignment.** v1 required ``len(pre_indices) ==
  len(post_indices)``. Period splits (``Dr.`` → ``Dr`` + ``.``),
  period deletions (``saw him .`` → ``saw him``), and number
  expansions (``23`` → ``twenty three``) all need different token
  counts on each side.

v2 fixes all three by (1) addressing tokens pre-MWT with
:class:`StanzaTokenOutput` carrying the post-MWT expansion, (2)
gold-per-side via :class:`Gold` so mismatched shapes are legal,
(3) mappings as first-class records instead of paired index tuples.

Purity
------
:func:`compare_stanza_outputs` is pure: given the synthesized
:class:`StanzaTokenOutput` inputs it produces a deterministic
:class:`DecisionComparison` without loading Stanza. Phase-1 tests
exercise this; the runner (Phase 2) constructs token outputs from
real Stanza Documents and feeds them to the same comparator.
