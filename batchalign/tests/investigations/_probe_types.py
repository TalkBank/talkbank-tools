"""Typed data model for the Stanza MWT probe matrix.

Every investigation probe case is a :class:`ProbeCase`. The 6-language
registry (``_cases/__init__.py``) aggregates per-language tuples into a
single :data:`LANGUAGE_MATRIX`. The matrix-driven test module
(``test_stanza_mwt_probe_matrix.py``) reads the registry, runs each case
through the paired (free-tokenize vs postprocessor) pipelines, and
enforces the per-case invariant.

Why typed data
--------------
Before the 2026-04-22 consolidation, probe cases were hand-built
``list[tuple[str, list[str]]]`` tables scattered across 5 test modules
(~1080 lines total). Each module reinvented xfail handling, invariant
selection, and pipeline-fixture plumbing. Types here capture the
intent so every new case declares what it means to pass, fail, or
xfail: rather than encoding that in function names and module-level
comments.

    Attributes
    ----------
    label
        Short identifier: used in pytest test IDs and in the rendered
        per-language book tables.
    words
        CHAT-derived word sequence fed to the Stanza pipeline. A tuple
        (not a list) so the dataclass stays hashable/frozen.
    phenomenon
        The linguistic construction class; see :class:`Phenomenon`.
    expected_post_mwt_count
        If set, the test asserts that the post-MWT-expansion Stanza
        word count equals this integer. Use ``len(words)`` for strict
        1-to-1 cases. If ``None``, the case is observe-only, the
        pipeline output is pinned via print but no assertion fires.
    xfail
        If set, the test marks itself xfail with the defect slug and
        reason. Applies only to the with-postprocessor path;
        free-tokenize always runs observe-only.
