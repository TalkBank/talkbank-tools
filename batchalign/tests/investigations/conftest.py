"""Shared Stanza pipeline fixtures for the CHAT-input investigation harness.

The investigation probes parametrize tests over ``(LanguageKey,
ProbeCase)`` pairs. Each test needs a Stanza pipeline matching
the pair's language: loaded once per language per session, not
per test invocation (pipeline load is ~5s).

The two fixtures here (:func:`post_pipeline_for` and
:func:`free_pipeline_for`) are module-scoped factories: they
return a callable that takes a ``LanguageKey`` and returns the
appropriate pipeline, caching per session in a closure dict.
Adding a new language requires no changes here, the factory
builds the pipeline on first request using the language's
alpha-2 code and the shared capability-aware processor selector
:func:`_processors_for`.
