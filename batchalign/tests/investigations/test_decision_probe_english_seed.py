"""Phase 3 structural tests for the English decision-probe seed.

Phase 3 populates the decision matrix with observe-only English
cases covering every :class:`CandidateClass`. The tests here verify
the *shape* of the seed — coverage across candidate classes and
internal consistency of every case. They do not run Stanza and do
not assert any linguistic verdict; Stanza-driven verdicts enter in
Phase 3 step 3 (adjudication) once the golden matrix has run on a
machine with real models.

Why this is structural-only
---------------------------
The whole point of Stanza-driven probes is to discover outcomes
empirically rather than asserting them from the author's
expectation. An author-written outcome assertion before running
Stanza would simply encode author bias — exactly what
``feedback_empirical_before_assertions`` warns against. So Phase 3
ships the *cases* here; the *verdicts* (non-``OBSERVE_ONLY``
expected outcomes) are set in a follow-up commit after the golden
run on a development machine.
