"""Phase 2 tests for the Stanza decision-probe matrix runner.

Mirrors the Phase 1 split from the MWT harness: the runner module
exists and is importable at non-golden test time, but the actual
parametrized Stanza-loading test function is marked
``@pytest.mark.golden`` and runs only on machines with real models.

Phase 2's validation is minimal per the spec: the runner imports
cleanly, the registry starts empty, and parametrize over an empty
matrix produces no collection errors. Phase 3 will seed English
cases into the registry.
