"""Structural coverage tests for the English MWT probe seed.

BA2-jan9 had an English apostrophe-contraction rule in
``tokenizer_processor()`` (ud.py:694-697): any token containing an
apostrophe was marked for contraction-preserving treatment except
``o'`` + word (so ``o'clock`` was excluded). BA3 does not have a
direct equivalent; Stanza's native English MWT processor is
expected to handle these.

The 2026-04-23 retokenization-gap audit
(``docs/investigations/2026-04-23-retokenization-gap-plan.md``)
surfaced that English had **zero MWT probe coverage**, the
existing ``_cases/english.py`` is for decision probes (capitalization
rules), not tokenization. A silent regression to `don't` or
`o'clock` handling would not be caught by any default or golden
test.

These tests assert the English seed is present in the MWT matrix
and covers the phenomena BA2 explicitly gated:

* standard contractions (expect MWT expansion to 2 UD words)
* possessives (expect MWT expansion)
* ``o'clock`` (control; expect NO expansion, BA2 explicitly
  excluded this from its contraction rule)
* native MWT baselines (if Stanza has any for English)

Runner tests in ``test_stanza_mwt_probe_matrix.py`` assert the
``expected_post_mwt_count`` values per case during golden runs.
