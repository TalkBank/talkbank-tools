Tests in this directory are Cantonese-specific integration tests
that validate the pipeline end-to-end with Cantonese-specific data and corpus requirements.

These are marked with @pytest.mark.cantonese_integration to allow skipping in fast CI.
The Stanza pipeline fixtures for English (and other languages) are reused from
