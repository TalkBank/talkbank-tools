"""End-to-end check that the Qwen3-ASR engine emits word-level timing.

Origin: 2026-05-27 v2 Cantonese ASR benchmark Bucket A. The recognizer loaded
an ASR model without a forced aligner and then asked for timestamps anyway.
The sidecar rejected that combination, the exception did not surface through
the V2 IPC, and a benchmark run sat at 0% CPU for 32 minutes before the
operator killed it. Word-level timestamps are load-bearing: the FA pipeline
injects them into `%wor`.

**The unit test that used to live here is gone, and its absence is the point.**
It monkeypatched the loader and asserted that a `forced_aligner` argument was
passed, which pinned a CALL SHAPE rather than an outcome: it could only ever
catch the mistake after someone had already written it, and it broke the moment
the engine moved off that package. The engine now loads through `LoadedQwen`,
a type with one constructor that produces both models or raises, so a
recognizer holding an ASR model and no aligner cannot be built at all. That
deleted the defect rather than watching for it, and the test went with it
(2026-08-20, native-transformers migration).

What survives here is what no type of ours can reach: real weights, real audio,
and whether the numbers that come back are usable. That still needs a test.
