"""Checkpoint-id handling for the native Qwen3-ASR engine.

The sidecar's bare repository ids (``Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B``) and the native
module's ``-hf`` ids both exist on the Hub, so a stale
``--engine-overrides '{"qwen_model": ...}'`` invocation would otherwise fail
somewhere deep inside a model loader instead of saying what to change. The
bare spelling was published in this project's own documentation for months,
so this path is reached by real command lines that already exist, not just
hypothetically.
