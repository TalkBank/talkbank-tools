"""Chunking for the native Qwen3-ASR engine.

This is one of two jobs BA3 took over from the `qwen-asr` package when the
engine moved onto `transformers`' native `qwen3_asr` module. Needs no model,
so these run in milliseconds. Runaway detection, the other job, and the
per-chunk decode budget it now reads first, are covered in
`test_qwen_decode_budget.py`.

What each property here is protecting:

* **Exact reconstruction.** A splitter that dropped or duplicated samples
  would still produce a fluent transcript, so nothing downstream would notice
  audio going missing.
* **Offsets.** The forced aligner reports times against the window it was
  handed. The offset is what makes them recording-relative, and omitting it
  produces timings that look reasonable and are silently wrong. FA emitted
  word timings 28.2 seconds past the end of their own audio on 6 of 226
  sessions once, undetected for two months, for exactly this reason.
