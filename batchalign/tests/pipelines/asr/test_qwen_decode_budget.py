"""Per-chunk and per-request decode budgeting, and the typed decode outcome,
for the native Qwen3-ASR engine.

Origin: a 411 s fleet job ran past the 1800 s job ceiling twice. Every ~180 s
chunk was decoded against one flat `max_new_tokens` cap with no wall-clock
stop, so a repetition-loop chunk paid the full cost of 4096 tokens of
greedy decoding before the runaway detector ever looked at the result, and a
10 s chunk was budgeted identically to a 180 s one.

`DecodeBudget` is the file-level wall-clock decode budget for one request,
built exactly once. `ChunkDecodeBudget.for_chunk` draws a chunk's own limits
down from what remains of it, so the SUM of every chunk's deadline can never
exceed the budget the request started with -- a per-chunk deadline computed
from the chunk alone, with no file-level ceiling, is exactly the shape that
let the 1800 s job ceiling blow past twice in one run.

`ChunkDecodeOutcome` (`Bounded` / `Completed`) records which bound fired, if
either, so `detect_runaway` no longer has to infer it from character density
alone.

None of this needs a model: everything here is a pure function over
`AudioChunk`, `DecodeBudget`, and the typed outcome.
