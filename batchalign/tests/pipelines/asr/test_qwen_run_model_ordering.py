"""`QwenRecognizer._run_model` must classify a chunk's decode outcome BEFORE
deciding whether its text counts as "no speech".

Origin: `_run_model` used to check `if not text.strip(): continue` before
ever calling `detect_runaway`. A `Bounded(DEADLINE, "")` chunk -- the
deadline fired before the model emitted anything -- has empty text exactly
like an ordinary silent `Completed` chunk, so the blank-text check silently
swallowed it: the fact that a chunk's decode was cut off by the deadline
never reached `refused`, `QwenTranscription`, or the log line downstream of
it. `detect_runaway` must run first; only a `Completed` outcome with empty
text is legitimate silence.

No model: `_get_model`, `_transcribe_chunk`, and the audio load are stubbed,
so this exercises the loop's control flow alone.
