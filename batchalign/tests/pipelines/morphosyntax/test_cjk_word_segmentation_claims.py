"""Verification of CJK word segmentation assumptions.

This test module proves or disproves the specific assumptions that motivated
the ``--retokenize`` word segmentation feature for Cantonese and Mandarin:

1. FunASR/SenseVoice Cantonese output is per-character (no word boundaries)
2. Tencent ASR preserves multi-character word boundaries
3. PyCantonese ``segment()`` produces linguistically correct word boundaries
4. Stanza's Chinese tokenizer can segment Mandarin text into words

Each test documents the assumption being verified and uses real library calls
(PyCantonese, batchalign_core Rust functions), not synthetic doubles.
