"""Retokenize-as-secondary-pass vs ASR engine segmentation for Cantonese.

Working hypothesis under test (2026-03): "Retokenize as a secondary pass
would do a better job than either Tencent or in particular FunAudio alone
since Stanza has a special model trained just for this task."

Three sub-claims to verify:
1. Stanza retokenize is better than FunASR alone (for Cantonese)
2. Stanza retokenize is better than Tencent alone (for Cantonese)
3. Stanza has a "special model trained just for this task" (for Chinese)

Key correction: for Cantonese, we use PyCantonese (not Stanza) for retokenize.
Stanza's zh model is trained on Mandarin, not Cantonese.
