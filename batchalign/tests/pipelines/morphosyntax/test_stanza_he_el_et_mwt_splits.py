"""Pure Stanza observation tests for Hebrew, Greek, and Estonian MWT.

These tests pin Stanza's actual MWT behavior on canonical
contraction/fusion constructions for each of the three languages
that flipped state in the 2026-04-15 capability-driven loader fix.
They have **no batchalign imports**; they are safe to copy verbatim
into a Stanza upstream issue if the observed behavior ever drifts.

Companion to ``test_stanza_fi_mwt_sos_leak.py`` (Defect 4 pattern).
The end-to-end CHAT-pipeline counterpart lives in
``test_he_el_mwt_end_to_end.py``.

Discovery date: 2026-04-15. The 2026-04-14 chunk_106 morphotag
outage exposed BA3's hardcoded ``MWT_LANGS`` set as drifted from
Stanza's catalog. Fixing the loader to consult the live capability
table flipped MWT-requesting behavior for several languages
(``swe`` False→False, ``heb`` False→True, ``ell`` False→True,
``est`` False→True). These tests document what each of the now-
enabled languages actually produces.

See ``book/src/reference/stanza-limitations.md`` Defect 5 for the
full write-up and the BA2-jan9 history that informed the choice.
