"""Observations: how Stanza handles contracted copula ``is`` (``'s``) in English.

Empirical-grounding tests for the BA3 morphotag Preserve-mode MWT regression
(2026-04-13). Each test isolates one question about Stanza's MWT behavior so
future contributors can see, in one file, exactly what Stanza does for these
constructions in each pipeline mode.

Sentences under test (typical clinical-narrative language samples with
contracted copula ``'s``):
    1. "the stool's going over", "stool is going" (copula + progressive)
    2. "and he's falling over"; "he is falling" (copula + progressive)
    3. "and the sink's overflowing", "sink is overflowing" (copula + progressive)
    4. "the lady's washing dishes", "lady is washing dishes" (copula + progressive)

All four are the same linguistic phenomenon: contracted copula ``is`` before
a present participle. The CHAT-correct MOR for the clitic in every case is
``aux|be-Fin-Ind-Pres-S3``. We use these tests to pin down WHERE (if
anywhere) that correct analysis is lost in the BA3 pipeline.

Three pipeline configurations are probed:

* ``english_pipeline_free_tokenize``: Stanza in fully unconstrained mode.
  This is the *baseline* for what Stanza-with-MWT can produce for these
  inputs. If Stanza fails here, the fix is not in BA3 plumbing.
* ``english_pipeline_with_postprocessor`` WITH ``original_words`` set
  simulates BA3 Preserve-mode (``retokenize=False``). If MWT Range tokens
  are merged back to Single tokens here, we've reproduced the regression
  at the Stanza-layer boundary.
* ``english_pipeline_with_postprocessor`` WITHOUT ``original_words``
  simulates BA3 Retokenize-mode. Expected to preserve Range tokens.

See the plan at ``~/.claude/plans/dazzling-singing-reddy.md`` for context.
