"""Test-only harness for the staged worker-protocol V2 FA roundtrip.

Rust integration tests use this script to prove the current staged boundary is
already coherent across languages:

1. Rust writes a typed V2 execute request with prepared artifacts.
2. Python reads that request and runs the staged V2 FA executor.
3. Python writes a typed V2 execute response.
4. Rust reads the response back into the established FA alignment domain.

The harness intentionally uses a deterministic fake FA host rather than real
models. Its job is to prove the contract, not model quality.
