# affects: batchalign/tests/conftest.py
"""Regression tests for the interactive pytest defaults installed by
``conftest._apply_interactive_pytest_defaults``.

Phase A2 of the test-cost revamp: interactive invocations get
fail-fast + failed-first ordering; CI keeps pytest's complete-report
behavior (queue-bound signal latency + flake-vs-systemic distinction
both favor full reports there); and a user's explicit CLI override
always wins.

The conftest hook reads environment + invocation-argv when it fires,
so these tests assert shapes that were already decided before
collection. Run in three flavors to exercise all three branches:

- ``uv run pytest batchalign/tests/test_a2_interactive_defaults.py``
  — interactive default
- ``CI=1 uv run pytest batchalign/tests/test_a2_interactive_defaults.py``
  — CI default
- ``uv run pytest batchalign/tests/test_a2_interactive_defaults.py --maxfail=0``
  — explicit user override (expected to respect the 0)
