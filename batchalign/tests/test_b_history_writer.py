# affects: batchalign/tests/_test_history.py
"""Unit tests for the per-test history writer (Phase B2 of the
test-cost revamp).

The writer is a thin SQLite wrapper: one row per test invocation,
keyed by ``(ts, test_id)``. A pytest hook in ``conftest.py`` feeds
it from ``pytest_runtest_logreport``; nextest can feed it from
post-run JSON parsing in a separate pass.

Tests cover:
  - Schema creation on first open (idempotent).
  - Round-trip of a single record.
  - Outcome, duration, commit_sha, framework fields persist.
  - Parent directory is created if missing.
  - Writer is resilient to being closed twice.
