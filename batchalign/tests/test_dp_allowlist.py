# Allowlisted `dp_align::align` call sites, BY FILE AND COUNT.
#
# One mapping, not a count beside a set of names. The previous form asserted
# `len(...) == 5` next to the set of files, so the two had to be kept in step
# by hand and the failure said only "6 != 5", naming neither the file that
# gained a call nor the one that lost one. A per-file count carries strictly
# more (engine.rs legitimately holds two) and the diff points at the change.
#
# dp_align is O(n*m), so a new call site is a decision worth recording rather
# than an incident worth blocking:
#
# - benchmark.rs: WER evaluation.
# - compare/engine.rs: transcript comparison (window alignment + rotation).
# - compare/cross_run.rs: cross-run agreement metrics for `compare-runs`.
# - chat_ops/fa/utr.rs: UTR global alignment, correctness critical and not
#   avoidable.
# - chat_ops/fa/utr/two_pass.rs: overlap-aware UTR timing recovery.
