"""The V2 FA execution host must be able to serve the Cantonese engine.

The host has carried a `canto_runner` field and the Rust bridge a matching
dispatch arm, while nothing built the runner, so a Cantonese request could not
be served even once the routing constructed one. The jyutping conversion was
unit-tested throughout; what was missing was the assembly.
