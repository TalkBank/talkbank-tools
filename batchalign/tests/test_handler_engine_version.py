"""Regression tests for the worker capability probe's engine_version slot.

Background: between 2026-05-07 and 2026-05-08 the capability probe in
``batchalign/worker/_handlers.py`` was observed emitting
``engine_versions[MORPHOSYNTAX] == "stanza"`` (the literal engine *name*)
when the worker had advertised capabilities before any Stanza model had
been loaded — because ``_state.stanza_version`` was empty and the probe
table's ``default_version`` for stanza-backed tasks was the bare string
``"stanza"``. The Rust provenance writer at
``crates/batchalign/src/provenance.rs`` then formatted that as
``engine=stanza-{engine_version}`` → ``engine=stanza-stanza`` in the
``[ba3 morphotag | ...]`` provenance comment of every output file.

The fix is to ALWAYS resolve the stanza version from the actual
importable package (``stanza.__version__``) when ``_state`` does not
already carry a model-loaded version. These tests pin the contract that
the resolver never returns the literal name as a version.
