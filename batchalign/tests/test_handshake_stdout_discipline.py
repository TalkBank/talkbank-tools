"""Regression: progress events use stdout consistently across the
pre-ready and post-ready windows.

The Rust supervisor's ``read_ready_line``
(``crates/batchalign/src/worker/handle/lifecycle.rs``) accepts
``{"op": "progress_v2", ...}`` lines as bootstrap-time preamble before
the ``{"ready": true, ...}`` envelope, emitting each as
``tracing::info!``. Stderr is buffered until process exit, so
bootstrap-time visibility requires the stdout path. Routing pre-ready
progress events to stderr would break that visibility contract.

(Earlier supervisor versions strictly read one JSON line as the ready
signal and rejected anything else, this test pinned a stderr-routing
contract for that older protocol. The 2026-05-06 supervisor change
relaxed the contract; this test was rewritten to track the new
behavior.)

``_print_ready`` and ``_print_ready_tcp`` flip
``_protocol._handshake_complete`` the moment the ready line is on the
wire so post-ready emissions also use stdout (now via ``_write_json``).
