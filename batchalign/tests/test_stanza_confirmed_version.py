"""The installed Stanza must be one whose behaviour we have adjudicated.

This is the check that turns the "Stanza version confirmed" column in the
defect-mitigation map from a note into something that fires. Without it, a bump
inherits every recorded confirmation for free and the only evidence that
anything changed is whichever golden tests happen to notice.

Deliberately NOT marked `golden`: it must run in the default suite, since its
whole job is to be seen immediately after someone edits the version constraint,
rather than during a model-downloading run they may not think to do.

This is a POLICY test, not an invariant a type could carry: "we have looked at
this version's behaviour" is a claim about work performed by people, and no
signature can express it. The type does as much as a type can, by making the
comparison total and correctly ordered; the rest is the record.
