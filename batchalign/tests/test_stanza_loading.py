"""Worker-side bootstrap policy for Stanza model loading.

Pins the contract that ``load_stanza_models`` performs a typed
preflight check against the capability table BEFORE calling
``stanza.Pipeline``: languages that Stanza's installed catalog
lists but ships no processor packages for must surface as a
domain ``UnsupportedLanguageError`` rather than as a deep
``KeyError`` from inside Stanza's resource-list loader.
