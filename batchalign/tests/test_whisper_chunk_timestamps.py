"""A Whisper chunk without a usable span must not be given one.

The HuggingFace pipeline can return a chunk whose ``timestamp`` is absent or
half-populated. The wire type it feeds, ``WhisperChunkSpanV2``, requires two
non-negative floats and validates ``end_s >= start_s``, so a producer that
hands it a missing value has to do something. It used to substitute ``0.0``,
which is not an absence: it is a real time at the very start of the audio, and
a chunk missing only its start then claimed to span from zero to its real end.

That also defeated the ``Option`` on the Rust side, which receives ``Some(0.0)``
rather than ``None`` and so never filters the token out.
