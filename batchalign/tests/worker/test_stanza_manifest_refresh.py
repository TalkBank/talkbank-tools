"""Integration regression: the worker refreshes a stale Stanza manifest.

2026-06-10 incident. Stanford re-published several lemma models under the
SAME Stanza resources version (1.12.0), changing their md5s. Every worker
pipeline is built with ``DownloadMethod.REUSE_RESOURCES``, which reuses the
cached ``resources.json`` and never re-fetches it, then verifies any
freshly-downloaded model against that cached manifest. A host whose cached
manifest predates the re-publish keeps the OLD md5, so the next model
download fails Stanza's integrity check
(``md5 for ... is X, expected Y`` -> surfaced as ``ensure_task failed``),
killing morphotag on any file that needs the re-published model. The trigger is
a bilingual transcript (e.g. ``eng,spa``) where a single ``[- spa]`` utterance
is the only item needing the re-published Spanish model.

Fix: the worker bootstrap (``batchalign/worker/_main.py::main``) refreshes a
present-but-stale ``resources.json`` from upstream once per worker, before any
model is loaded, guarded so an offline worker falls back to the cached manifest
instead of failing. The refresh lives in the worker bootstrap, NOT in
``get_cached_capability_table`` (which tests and tooling also call and which
must not trigger a network fetch or mutate the real on-disk cache).

These tests drive the REAL worker subprocess
(``python -m batchalign.worker --lazy --profile stanza``: it runs the full
bootstrap but loads no models, signalling ready immediately) and serve the
"new" manifest from a local HTTP server, so they are fully deterministic and
never touch Stanford's servers.
