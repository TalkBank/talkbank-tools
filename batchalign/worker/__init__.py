"""Stateless ML inference worker for Rust server IPC.

This package is the Python data-plane process used by the Rust worker pool.
The Rust side spawns this as a child process and communicates over stdin/stdout.

Protocol:
    Startup (worker -> parent):
        {"ready": true, "pid": 12345, "transport": "stdio"}

    Request (parent -> worker):
        {"op": "infer", "request": <InferRequest>}
        {"op": "batch_infer", "request": <BatchInferRequest>}
        {"op": "execute_v2", "request": <ExecuteRequestV2>}
        {"op": "health"}
        {"op": "capabilities"}
        {"op": "shutdown"}

    Response (worker -> parent):
        {"op": "infer", "response": <InferResponse>}
        {"op": "batch_infer", "response": <BatchInferResponse>}
        {"op": "execute_v2", "response": <ExecuteResponseV2>}
        {"op": "health", "response": <HealthResponse>}
        {"op": "capabilities", "response": <CapabilitiesResponse>}
        {"op": "shutdown"}
        {"op": "error", "error": "..."}

Usage:
    uv run python -m batchalign.worker --task asr --lang eng
    uv run python -m batchalign.worker --test-echo --task morphosyntax
