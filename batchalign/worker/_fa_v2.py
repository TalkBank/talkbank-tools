"""Thin worker-protocol V2 forced-alignment wrapper.

Rust now owns the prepared-artifact reads, request validation, backend dispatch,
and typed V2 response shaping for the worker FA boundary. Python stays only at
the model-host callback edge.

**See also:** `../../INTERFACE_MAP.md` section "3. Forced Alignment V2" for:
- Rust FFI function: `crates/batchalign-pyo3/src/worker_fa_exec.rs::execute_forced_alignment_request_v2()`
- Full Rust/Python responsibility split and input/output contracts.

Concurrency note
----------------
The GPU worker serves V2 requests via ``_serve_stdio_concurrent(max_threads=4)``,
which dispatches up to 4 requests simultaneously through a ``ThreadPoolExecutor``.
PyTorch releases the GIL during compute, so threads truly run in parallel on the
CPU side.  However, the torchaudio MMS_FA / ``forced_align`` kernel is **not
thread-safe** for concurrent CPU execution from multiple threads, concurrent
calls cause SIGSEGV/SIGABRT in LibTorch, crashing the entire worker process and
failing every pending request in the job.

``_fa_inference_lock`` serializes all calls to ``execute_forced_alignment_request_v2``
so that only one FA inference runs at a time.  The lock is module-level (one per
worker process), which is the correct granularity, each GPU worker process is a
single Python interpreter serving one language's models.
