"""Infer and ``batch_infer`` dispatch routers.

This module is the request-time counterpart to the worker bootstrap modules.
Its job is deliberately narrow:

- accept typed inference requests from the stdio protocol layer
- route each task to the correct pure inference helper
- inject only the preloaded runtime state that task actually needs

It must not grow into a pipeline-orchestration layer. CHAT parsing, job
ownership, retries, and workflow policy remain on the Rust side.
