    2. Nothing. There is no default, because there is no case left that needs
       one: the control plane names an engine for every task the worker's
       target preloads (`EngineSelection::for_target`), and a lazy-profile
       worker preloads nothing and names its engine per request. A missing
       ``fa`` key therefore means the boundary is broken, and guessing would
       load a model the request did not ask for.
