"""JSON-lines IPC loops for the Python worker (stdio and TCP transports).

Stdio modes:

- ``_serve_stdio()`` — sequential request/response, one at a time. Used by
  Stanza and IO profile workers where requests are CPU-bound and GIL-limited.
- ``_serve_stdio_concurrent()`` — dispatches requests to a
  ``ThreadPoolExecutor``, enabling concurrent GPU inference. Used by GPU
  profile workers where PyTorch releases the GIL during computation, allowing
  real parallelism across threads sharing the same loaded models.

TCP modes (persistent daemon workers):

- ``_serve_tcp()`` — sequential request/response over a TCP socket.
- ``_serve_tcp_concurrent()`` — concurrent GPU dispatch over a TCP socket.

TCP workers listen on ``(host, port)``, accept one connection at a time (the
Rust server reconnects on drop), and use the same JSON-lines protocol as
stdio. The only difference is the transport — all dispatch logic is shared.
