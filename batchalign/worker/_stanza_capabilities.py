"""Stanza capability table builder — single source of truth.

Reads Stanza's ``resources.json`` to discover per-language processor
availability.  Replaces 7 scattered hardcoded tables across Python and
Rust with one authoritative data structure built from the installed
Stanza version.

The table is built once (lazily) and cached for the process lifetime.

On a fresh install where Stanza's resource catalog has never been seeded,
``resources.json`` does not yet exist. In that case the builder bootstraps
the catalog by calling Stanza's own ``download_resources_json()`` (a small,
fast download — the catalog itself, no language packs) and retries.
Language packs are then downloaded lazily by ``stanza.Pipeline()`` on first
use of each language. The end user never has to seed anything by hand.

A real network/disk failure during catalog bootstrap surfaces as the typed
``StanzaCatalogDownloadError`` rather than a silent ``None`` — the original
silent-None path masked the bug whose downstream effect was a worker
exit-1 retry storm with multi-GB log spam from a deterministic catalog
miss.
