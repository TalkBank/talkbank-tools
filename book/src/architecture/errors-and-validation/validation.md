# Validation

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-06-21 23:23 EDT

CHAT validation runs at multiple points in the processing pipeline.
All validation logic is in Rust: `talkbank-model::validation` owns
CHAT-core validation, and `talkbank_transform::validate`
(`crates/talkbank-transform/src/validate.rs`) owns the Batchalign-side
pre/post validation gate functions (`validate_to_level`,
`validate_output`). This page covers validity levels, pre/post
validation gates, severity posture, the verification-gate set
(G0-G14), and how validation failures interact with caches and bug
reports.

For the CHAT-core error-code infrastructure (codes, sinks, severities,
layers), now owned by chatter, see
[chat-core-errors](https://talkbank.github.io/chatter/architecture/errors-and-validation/chat-core-errors.html).
For the diagnostic UX standard, see
[error-diagnostics-ux](https://talkbank.github.io/chatter/architecture/errors-and-validation/error-diagnostics-ux.html).

## Validity Levels

The `ValidityLevel` enum defines three cumulative validation levels.
Each level includes all checks from lower levels.

| Level | Name | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | `Parseable` | No parse errors (clean tree-sitter CST) |
| L1 | `StructurallyComplete` | `@Participants` and `@Languages` present, all speaker codes declared, every utterance has a terminator |
| L2 | `MainTierValid` | Well-formed words, valid timing bullets if present |

### Pre-validation gates

Each command requires input to meet a minimum level before
processing:

| Command | Required level |
|---|---|
| `morphotag` | `MainTierValid` |
| `utseg` | `StructurallyComplete` |
| `translate` | `StructurallyComplete` |
| `coref` | `StructurallyComplete` |
| `align` | `Parseable` (lenient, must handle messy real-world files) |

`validate_to_level()` checks the file against the required level and
returns all failures found. Invalid files are rejected early with
diagnostics, before any compute is spent on inference.

## Post-Serialization Validation

After an orchestrator injects results and serializes CHAT output, the
server runs `validate_output()`:

1. **Alignment validation**: checks that `%mor`/`%gra`/`%wor` tier
   word counts match the main tier. ParseHealth-aware: utterances
   flagged as unparseable during lenient parsing are excluded.
2. **Semantic validation**: full CHAT validation:
   - **E362**: non-monotonic timestamps (utterance bullets must
     increase).
   - **E701** / **E704**: temporal constraints (overlap rules,
     same-speaker timing).
   - Header correctness, required headers present and well-formed.
   - Cross-utterance patterns, speaker code consistency.

Only blocks on `severity="error"`, not warnings.

## Severity Posture

Validation intentionally distinguishes errors from warnings:

- **Errors** block output. The server will not write CHAT with
  error-level validation failures.
- **Warnings** are reported but do not block. Legacy corpora contain
  widespread minor violations that must remain processable.

This distinction matters especially for `%gra`:

- Existing broken `%gra` in old corpora may be accepted with warnings
  so files remain processable.
- Newly generated `%gra` from batchalign3 is validated more strictly
  before writeback.

## Bug Reports and Cache Purges

When post-serialization validation fails:

1. A structured bug report is written to
   `~/.batchalign3/bug-reports/`.
2. Cache entries that produced the invalid output are purged
   (self-correcting cache).

This prevents broken results from being served on future runs.

## Verification Gates (`make verify`)

The mandatory pre-merge / pre-push gate. All gates must pass before
any code or doc change ships:

| Gate | What it checks |
|---|---|
| G0 | Parser signature guardrail |
| G1 | Rust workspace compile check |
| G2 | Spec tools compile check |
| G3 | Spec runtime tools compile check |
| G4 | CHAT manual anchor links |
| G5 | Generated parser corpus equivalence suite |
| G6 | Golden fragment validity (words + tiers) |
| G7 | Bare-timestamp regression gate |
| G8 | Reference corpus semantic equivalence |
| G9 | `%wor` tier parsing and alignment |
| G10 | Golden tier roundtrip (`%mor`, `%gra`, `%pho`, `%wor`) |
| G11 | Reference corpus node coverage |
| G12 | Generated artifacts match committed sources |
| G13 | Fuzz workspace isolation |
| G14 | Imported Batchalign Rust/PyO3 gate |

The reference corpus at `corpus/reference/` is the sacred semantic
target, every file must be valid CHAT, and `make verify` runs each
gate against it.

The pre-push hook (`make install-hooks`) runs the fast subset (`fmt`,
affected compile, parser guardrail, `generated-check`, `fuzz-check`)
locally before push. CI runs the full set.

## Validation at the PyO3 Boundary

There is no public Python validation API. The `ParsedChat` handle
that previously exposed `validate()` / `validate_structured()` /
`validate_chat_structured()` was retired in the 2026-03-21 PyO3
slimdown to worker-runtime-only. Validation now runs entirely on the
Rust side; when a worker invocation detects a failure it constructs
`BatchalignBoundaryError::ChatValidation { entries, … }` which the
PyO3 boundary lowers into a `CHATValidationException` carrying a
populated `errors: list[ValidationErrorEntry]` on the Python side.

Python callers that need structured validation results invoke
`batchalign3` via subprocess and catch the exception:

```python
from batchalign_core import CHATValidationException

try:
    batchalign_core.execute_v2(request)
except CHATValidationException as exc:
    for entry in exc.errors:
        print(entry.code, entry.line, entry.message)
```

See [Errors, Batchalign Runtime](batchalign-errors.md) and
[Python ↔ Rust errors](python-rust-errors.md) for the full boundary
contract.

## Known limitations

- **Validation rules are intentionally permissive on legacy data.**
  Some checks emit warnings rather than errors so legacy corpora
  remain processable while still surfacing the issue. Examples: pre-existing
  malformed `%gra` (warned, not blocked, so files that already shipped
  with bad `%gra` round-trip cleanly); some bullet-format minor
  variants. Newly generated tiers from batchalign are validated more
  strictly before writeback.
- **`%wor` word counts are not validated against the main tier.** `%wor`
  is a timing-annotation tier with no downstream positional indexing;
  legacy files may have `xxx`, fragments, or nonwords in `%wor`
  without producing alignment errors.
- **Cross-utterance quotation validation is gated off by default**
  (`enable_quotation_validation` flag), the cross-utterance walker
  exists but is not yet wired into the standard validation gate.
- **Some error-spec / validator pairs are not yet implemented.**
  Tracked in `spec/errors/` files marked `Status: not_implemented`;
  these generate `#[ignore]` tests via `make test-gen` rather than
  failing CI. Run `grep -rl "Status.*not_implemented" spec/errors/`
  to enumerate.
