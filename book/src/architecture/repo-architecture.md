schema/                   JSON Schema for ChatFile AST
tests/                    workspace-level integration tests and fixtures
fuzz/                     fuzz targets (separate Cargo workspace)
book/                     mdBook documentation source
docs/                     release-contract policy documents and the auto-generated error catalog
```

## Architectural principles

1. Clear boundaries between specification, generation, runtime
   logic, and documentation.
2. Generated artifacts and hand-authored code are kept separate with
   hard guardrails — `parser.c`, `node-types.json`, generated tests
   and error-doc artifacts are never edited by hand.
3. Each crate has a single clear responsibility.
4. Entry-point docs guide new contributors to authoritative
   references quickly.

## Canonical ownership rules

- `spec/` owns the language intent and accepted examples — what
  CHAT *means*.
- `grammar/` owns tokenization and CST shape only, not semantic
  validation policy.
- `talkbank-model` owns semantic validity, serialization
  invariants, error types, and parser API contracts.
- `talkbank-transform` owns pipelines and JSON schema validation.
- `batchalign` (the crate) owns the Batchalign-specific runtime,
  server, and ML-pipeline orchestration; it consumes the talkbank-*
  crates above.

## Dependency direction rules

1. `spec` does not depend on runtime crates.
2. `grammar` is consumed by parser crates, not vice versa.
3. `talkbank-model` is dependency-minimal and stable; all other
   talkbank-* crates depend on it.
4. The `batchalign` crate consumes the talkbank-* core crates
   (model, parser, transform, etc.) but never reimplements CHAT
   primitives.
5. CLI / LSP / desktop apps depend on stable internal APIs, never
   directly on unstable internals of other crates.
6. Generator tools may read specs and grammar metadata but do not
   become runtime dependencies.

## Acceptance criteria

- Every top-level directory has a clear purpose statement.
- No crate depends on internal modules outside declared boundaries.
- No generated artifact is edited manually.
- New contributors can identify authoritative docs in less than
  five minutes.
