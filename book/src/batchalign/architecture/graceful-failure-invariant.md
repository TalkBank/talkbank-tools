# Graceful Failure Invariant

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-23 23:52 EDT

## The rule

Every per-item runtime error from a Python worker, engine failure,
network failure, model error, protocol violation, propagates to the
caller as a **typed failure**. No code path silently drops a per-item
error and emits an empty success-shaped response in its place.

This rule is system-wide. It applies to every command in batchalign3:
`align`, `transcribe`, `morphotag`, `translate`, `utseg`, `coref`,
`benchmark`, `opensmile`, `avqi`, `compare`.

## Why this rule exists

The opposite shape, log a warning, push an empty response, continue,
turns failures into invisible data loss. A user runs the job, the
job exits "successfully", the output file is shorter than it should
be, and the only signal lives in a tracing log nobody reads. We have
seen this pattern produce missing `%xtra` tiers when Google Translate
is GFW-blocked, missing `%mor` tiers when Stanza's per-item output is
malformed, missing utseg assignments when a constituency tree is
malformed, and missing `%xcoref` annotations when the coref worker
fails on one document inside a cross-file batch. Each instance looks
like a successful job to the operator until somebody manually audits
the output.

The rule is therefore: **if any item failed, the file fails.** No
partial output is written for a failed file. The user sees a typed
error message that names the failing items, not a tracing-log
forensics exercise.

## The shape

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    item["Per-item engine call"]
    item -->|"success"| ok["Ok(Response)"]
    item -->|"engine/network/model error"| err["Err(message)"]
    item -->|"protocol violation\n(no error AND no payload)"| err

    ok --> collect["Driver collects Vec\<Result\<R, String\>\>"]
    err --> collect

    collect --> attribute["Attribute per-item Err to source file\nvia per_file_info slice"]
    attribute -->|"any Err\nfor this file"| fail["TextWorkflowFileError::ItemErrors\n(file marked failed, no output)"]
    attribute -->|"all Ok\nfor this file"| apply["hooks.apply(chat_file, items, responses)\nfile serialized to output"]
```

A per-file batch sees each item as either `Ok(R)` (engine succeeded
and produced a typed payload) or `Err(String)` (the engine reported
a runtime error, or the worker returned neither error nor payload).
The driver, `run_text_batch_pipeline` in
`crates/batchalign/src/pipeline/text_infer.rs`: groups per-item
results back to their source file via `per_file_info` and writes one
of two outcomes per file:

- `TextBatchFileResult::ok(filename, chat_text)`: every item
  succeeded for this file; the file's `%xtra` / `%mor` / etc. tier
  is injected and the file is serialized to the output.
- `TextBatchFileResult::err(filename,
  TextWorkflowFileError::ItemErrors { command, total, samples })` —
  one or more items failed; no output is written. The error carries
  the command label, total failure count, and up to
  `MAX_ITEM_ERROR_SAMPLES` (5) sample messages for diagnostics.

Other files in the same cross-file batch are unaffected, they
follow their own outcome. This matches BA2's per-file isolation
semantics (BA2 ran each file in its own future; one file failing
did not kill its neighbors).

## The typed error

`TextWorkflowFileError` (in `crates/batchalign/src/text_batch.rs`)
has two variants:

```rust,ignore
pub(crate) enum TextWorkflowFileError {
    /// Batch-level: worker spawn, IPC, schema, pre- or
    /// post-validation, serialization. No per-item attribution.
    Batch(String),

    /// Per-item: one or more items failed. The first N samples are
    /// retained inline; the rest are counted in `total`.
    ItemErrors {
        command: &'static str,
        total: usize,
        samples: Vec<ItemError>,
    },
}
```

`ItemError` carries the position in the file's payload list and the
engine's error string verbatim:

```rust,ignore
pub(crate) struct ItemError {
    pub item_index: usize,
    pub message: String,
}
```

Engine-class typing (`NetworkError` vs `ModelError` vs
`ProtocolError` as separate variants) is deliberately not yet
modelled. The Python worker's error strings already carry the class
verbatim (`"Translation failed: ConnectionResetError(...)"`,
`"Failed to parse raw Stanza output ..."`); a typed split is a
future change with a downstream consumer.

## Where the rule applies in code

Today the rule is enforced at these seams:

| Layer | File | Function | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Driver (per-file) | `crates/batchalign/src/pipeline/text_infer.rs` | `run_text_pipeline` | Single-file flow; per-item Err collapses to one typed `ServerError::Validation` |
| Driver (cross-file) | `crates/batchalign/src/pipeline/text_infer.rs` | `run_text_batch_pipeline` | Cross-file flow; per-item Err attributed back to source file via `per_file_info` |
| Shared helper | `crates/batchalign/src/text_batch.rs` | `unwrap_per_item_results` | Collapses `Vec<Result<R, String>>` → `Result<Vec<R>, TextWorkflowFileError>` |
| translate worker | `crates/batchalign/src/translate.rs` | `parse_translate_item_results` | Per-item parsing; engine error and protocol violation both → `Err` |
| utseg worker | `crates/batchalign/src/utseg.rs` | `infer_batch` | Same shape |
| coref worker | `crates/batchalign/src/coref.rs` | `infer_batch` | Per-document (one item per file) |
| morphotag worker | `crates/batchalign/src/morphosyntax/worker.rs` | `infer_batch_single` | Per-item; Stanza-parse-failure folded into per-item Err |
| Python worker (utseg) | `batchalign/inference/utseg.py` | `_parse_tree_indices` | Raises `AttributeError` on malformed tree (previously returned `[]`) |

## What's NOT covered by this rule

Two patterns look superficially like silent failure but are
**intentional fallbacks** that the rule does not cover:

1. **`L2|xxx` morphotag fallback** for code-switches into Stanza-
   unsupported languages. `infer_batch_per_item` marks those items
   `Ok(UdResponse { sentences: vec![] })`, and downstream
   `inject_results` skips the empty UdResponse so the existing
   `L2|xxx` placeholder stays in `%mor`. This is BA2-parity behavior
   for languages Stanza cannot analyze, the empty response is the
   feature, not a missing result.

2. **Dummy / empty-payload files passed through unchanged.** A file
   with no eligible utterances (e.g. coref on a non-English file)
   serializes to the output unchanged. No worker call is made; the
   absence of `%xcoref` is the correct result.

Both fallbacks emit `Ok` outputs, not `Err`. The graceful-failure
invariant covers only the `Err` path.

## Capability advertisement vs runtime errors

Capability-probe failures (e.g. `worker/_handlers.py::_capabilities`
catching an exception when building `stanza_capabilities`) are
intentionally lenient: the worker advertises an empty capability
set and the controller picks an alternate worker if one exists.
Capability advertisement is not user-facing work; the runtime path
where actual job items get processed is the path this invariant
governs.
