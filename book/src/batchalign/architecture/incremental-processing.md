# Incremental Processing

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-19 20:10 EDT

Incremental processing allows batchalign to reprocess only the utterances that
changed after a user edits a CHAT file, preserving cached dependent tiers
(`%mor`, `%gra`, `%wor`, bullets) for unchanged content. This is the key
enabler for the **transcribe → manual review → re-align** workflow.

## Motivation

The standard workflow is:

1. Run `transcribe` on audio → initial CHAT with ASR output
2. User reviews: fixes words, splits/merges utterances, corrects speakers
3. Run `morphotag` and/or `align` on the edited file

Without incremental processing, step 3 reprocesses every utterance even if
only 3 out of 50 changed. For morphosyntax, this means redundant Stanza
inference calls. For forced alignment, this means re-aligning audio for groups
whose words and existing timing are still structurally trustworthy.

The diff engine solves this by comparing the "before" version (pre-edit, with
existing dependent tiers) against the "after" version (post-edit) and computing
a precise per-utterance change classification.

## Architecture

```text
Before CHAT (with %mor/%gra/%wor/bullets)
   │
   ├── parse_lenient() → ChatFile₁
   │
After CHAT (user-edited)
   │
   ├── parse_lenient() → ChatFile₂
   │
   ▼
diff_chat(before, after) → Vec<UtteranceDelta>
   │
   ├── Unchanged    → copy dependent tiers from before
   ├── SpeakerChanged → copy dependent tiers (words identical)
   ├── TimingOnly   → copy %mor/%gra, re-align FA group
   ├── WordsChanged → reprocess NLP, re-align FA group if timing changed
   ├── Inserted     → process from scratch
   └── Deleted      → absent from output
```

### Layer 1: Diff Engine (`crates/batchalign-transform/src/diff/`)

The diff engine lives in `talkbank-transform` and has no server
dependencies. It operates purely on `ChatFile` ASTs.

**Algorithm:**

1. Extract Mor-domain words per utterance from both files using
   `extract_words()`.
2. Compute fingerprints: space-joined cleaned word text per utterance.
3. Run Hirschberg DP alignment on the fingerprint sequences (reusing the
   existing `dp_align::align()` infrastructure).
4. Post-process the alignment to detect substitution pairs (adjacent
   `ExtraPayload` + `ExtraReference` from the DP aligner).
5. Classify each result into an `UtteranceDelta`.

For matched pairs (same fingerprint), the classifier checks speaker codes and
bullet timing to distinguish `Unchanged`, `TimingOnly`, and `SpeakerChanged`.

**Files:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `diff/types.rs` | `UtteranceDelta` enum, `DiffSummary` |
| `diff/classify.rs` | `diff_chat()`: DP alignment + classification |
| `diff/preserve.rs` | `copy_dependent_tiers()`: tier transfer between files |

### Layer 2: Selective Orchestrators (`batchalign`)

Each orchestrator has an `_incremental` variant that accepts both `before_text`
and `after_text`, runs the diff, and selectively reprocesses.

#### Morphosyntax (`process_morphosyntax_incremental`)

```text
1. Parse before and after
2. diff_chat(before, after) → deltas
3. For Unchanged/SpeakerChanged/TimingOnly:
     copy_dependent_tiers(%mor, %gra) from before → after
4. For WordsChanged/Inserted:
     collect payloads, check cache, infer, inject
5. Serialize
```

Only the utterances that need NLP reprocessing are sent to the Stanza worker.
Cache hits are still checked for changed utterances (the new content might
match a previous cache entry).

#### Forced Alignment (`process_fa_incremental`)

FA operates on groups (time windows containing multiple utterances), but the
incremental path now preserves stable utterance-level timing before it decides
which groups need worker or cache work:

```text
1. Parse before and after
2. diff_chat(before, after) → deltas
3. For Unchanged / SpeakerChanged / TimingOnly utterances:
     copy %wor from before → after
     refresh main-tier word timing and utterance bullet from %wor
4. Group utterances in the refreshed "after" file
5. For each group:
     if every utterance in the group was refreshed successfully:
       → reuse current main-tier timing directly
     else:
       → check cache, then send misses to the FA worker
6. Inject remaining timings and serialize
```

This gives `align --before` three tiers of reuse:

1. full-file `%wor` refresh when the whole file is already reusable
2. per-utterance `%wor` preservation for unchanged regions in an edited file
3. cache lookup and worker FA only for the remaining changed groups

A single changed utterance still causes its containing FA group to be
re-aligned when that group cannot be reconstructed from preserved timing. But
stable groups no longer have to go back through audio alignment just because
the file contains edits elsewhere.

### Layer 3: Dispatch Integration (`runner/dispatch/`)

The dispatch layer reads optional `before_paths` from the job and routes to
incremental variants when a "before" file is available:

```rust,ignore
let fa_result = if let Some(ref bt) = before_text {
    process_fa_incremental(bt, &chat_text, &audio, services, fa_params, progress).await
} else {
    process_fa(&chat_text, &audio, services, fa_params, progress).await
};
```

For morphosyntax, the batched dispatch similarly checks `before_texts`:

```text
if !before_texts.is_empty() {
    // Per-file incremental path
    process_morphosyntax_incremental(before, after, services, &params).await
} else {
    // Batch path
    process_morphosyntax_batch(&files, services, &params).await
}
```

## `UtteranceDelta` Type

```rust,ignore
pub enum UtteranceDelta {
    Unchanged     { before_idx, after_idx },
    WordsChanged  { before_idx, after_idx, timing_changed: bool },
    TimingOnly    { before_idx, after_idx },
    SpeakerChanged { before_idx, after_idx },
    Inserted      { after_idx },
    Deleted       { before_idx },
}
```

Helper methods:

| Method | Returns `true` for |
|--------|--------------------|
| `needs_nlp_reprocessing()` | `WordsChanged`, `Inserted` |
| `affects_timing()` | `WordsChanged` (with timing), `TimingOnly`, `Inserted`, `Deleted` |
| `before_idx()` | All except `Inserted` |
| `after_idx()` | All except `Deleted` |

## Dependent Tier Preservation

`copy_dependent_tiers()` in `diff/preserve.rs` transfers specified tiers from
a "before" utterance to an "after" utterance using the existing
`replace_or_add_tier()` injection function. It's idempotent, safe to call
multiple times.

```rust,ignore
copy_dependent_tiers(
    &before_file, before_idx,
    &mut after_file, after_idx,
    &[TierKind::Mor, TierKind::Gra],
);
```

## "Before" File Sources

| Context | Before source | After source |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| `--in-place` CLI | Current file on disk | Same file (pre-edit is the "before") |
| `--before` flag | Explicit path | Input file |
| REST API | `before_text` field | File content |
| First run | None → full processing | Input file |

When no "before" is available, the orchestrator falls back to full processing
automatically.

## Fallback Behavior

The incremental path falls back to full processing when:

- No "before" text is provided (first run)
- All utterances changed (`summary.unchanged == 0 && summary.speaker_changed == 0`)
- The diff engine cannot establish any correspondence

This ensures incremental processing is always safe, worst case, it does the
same work as batch processing, while the best common rerun case avoids both
cache lookup misses and worker FA for stable regions.

## Command Applicability

| Command | Incremental? | Granularity | Behavior |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `morphotag` | Yes | Per-utterance | Skip unchanged; reprocess changed words |
| `align` | Yes | Per-group | Any changed utterance in a group → re-align group |
| `utseg` | Not yet | Per-utterance | Would skip unchanged utterances |
| `translate` | Not yet | Per-utterance | Would skip unchanged utterances |
| `transcribe` | N/A | Whole-file | Creates from scratch (audio → text) |
| `coref` | N/A | Whole-document | Context-dependent, must reprocess entirely |

## Cache Interaction

The per-utterance BLAKE3 cache complements the diff engine:

- **Cache hit on unchanged utterance:** Diff engine preserves tiers directly
  from "before", cache isn't even consulted for these.
- **Cache hit on changed utterance:** The new content might match a previous
  cache entry (e.g., fixing a typo back to the original). Cache is checked
  for all utterances that need reprocessing.
- **Cache miss on changed utterance:** Normal path, infer and cache the result.

The diff engine adds value beyond caching by preserving dependent tier
*alignment* (the cache stores NLP results, but tier injection requires the
full AST context) and by enabling FA group-level optimization (cache is
per-utterance, but FA operates per-group).

## Performance Impact

For a file with 50 utterances where 3 were edited:

| Path | Worker calls | Cache checks |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Batch | 50 utterance payloads | 50 |
| Incremental | 3 utterance payloads | 3 |

For FA with 8 groups where 1 contains a changed utterance:

| Path | FA groups aligned |
|------|-------------------|
| Batch | 8 |
| Incremental | 1 |
