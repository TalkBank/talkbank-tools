# Apple MPS Workarounds

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-01 09:47 EDT

## MPS Exclusion Policy

**MPS is excluded from ALL model loaders.** All GPU-profile workers
(ASR, FA, Speaker) run on CPU when CUDA is unavailable. MPS is never
used, on any fleet machine.

### Why: confirmed unsafe behavior

FA workloads on MPS can produce AGXG14X shutdown stalls on Apple
Silicon hardware. The failure path goes through
`batchalign_core::worker_fa_exec::run_wave2vec_like` →
`at::mps::MPSStream::executeMPSGraph`, with very large memory
footprint, low free disk, `ffmpeg` `No space left on device` failures
while building media-cache WAVs and FA temp PCM, and follow-on shared
GPU worker crashes.

That is enough to treat MPS as unsafe by default.

There is no user-space mitigation for the AGX deadlock path. You cannot:
- Time out the operation (kernel mutex, not user-space)
- Kill the stuck process (unkillable zombie in kernel sleep)
- Break the compute into smaller chunks (deadlock can trigger on normal 5–30s chunks)
- Use a subprocess watchdog (PyTorch MPS silently hangs or SIGSEGVs in forks:
  [pytorch/pytorch#178037](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/178037))

MPS exclusion alone is not sufficient: long FA jobs can fill both
`~/Library/Application Support/batchalign3/media_cache/` and
`/var/folders/.../fa_v2/audio/` if internal free space is already low.
Apple-performance work must therefore include cache cleanup and
temp-space admission control, not just device selection.

### Ecosystem evidence

No major ML project defaults to MPS:

| Project | MPS status |
|---------|-----------|
| **OpenAI Whisper** | PR [#382](https://github.com/openai/whisper/pull/382) to enable MPS was never merged — users reported crashes, MPS slower than CPU |
| **faster-whisper** | MPS not supported at all (`ValueError: unsupported device mps`) |
| **pyannote-audio** | MPS produces wrong timestamps ([#1337](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/issues/1337), closed wontfix); kernel crashes on M4 ([#1886](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/issues/1886)) |
| **whisper.cpp** | Uses Metal API directly, bypassing PyTorch MPS entirely |
| **PyTorch Lightning** | MPS marked "experimental" |

Representative open PyTorch MPS issues:
- [#178497](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/178497): `sum`, `mean`, `count_nonzero` give wrong results — confirmed by PyTorch team as originating in Apple's MPS framework
- [#179352](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/179352): `scaled_dot_product_attention` incorrect for large batches (cosine similarity 0.49 vs CPU)
- [#154329](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/154329): memory leak (~1 MB/sec) confirmed on M4 Max/Studio
- [#144634](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/144634): `torch.mps.synchronize()` hangs on error — Apple engineer acknowledged, still open

Apple has not publicly acknowledged the AGXG14X kernel deadlock.

### Deadlock and hang categories

Two PyTorch issues carry the dual labels `module: mps` + `module: deadlock`:

1. [pytorch/pytorch#144634](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/144634) —
   `torch.mps.synchronize()` hangs on shader fault.
   Filed by PyTorch maintainer `@malfet`: "few `attempt[s]` to reproduce the same
   resulted in **system hang**." Apple engineer acknowledged, still open.

2. [pytorch/pytorch#162872](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/162872) —
   `Event.synchronize()` deadlocks before `elapsed_time()`. Reproduced on
   M4 Pro. Simple timing code hangs permanently.

Additionally:

- [pytorch/pytorch#178037](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/178037) —
  MPS silently hangs or SIGSEGVs in forked subprocesses. Unlike CUDA, MPS
  had no `_lazy_init()` check in forked children. This rules out the
  "watchdog subprocess" mitigation strategy.

- The MLX project documented macOS GPU watchdog kills at
  [ml-explore/mlx#3267](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/issues/3267): the
  error `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorImpactingInteractivity` fires when a
  Metal command buffer blocks WindowServer compositing for too long. An
  undocumented env var `AGX_RELAX_CDM_CTXSTORE_TIMEOUT=1` exists but is
  unsupported; MLX maintainers marked this "wontfix."

### Silent correctness failures

The most insidious MPS problem is not crashes but **silently wrong results**:

- A class of issues are labeled `module: mps` + `module: correctness (silent)`.
- Reductions (`sum`, `mean`, `nansum`, `trace`, `count_nonzero`) give wrong
  results when called in rapid succession — confirmed by PyTorch team as
  originating in Apple's MPS framework itself, not PyTorch
  ([#178497](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/178497))
- `scaled_dot_product_attention` returns incorrect output for large
  batch × sequence products — cosine similarity drops to 0.49 vs CPU
  ([#179352](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/179352))
- "Catastrophically wrong gradients" (1,000×–100,000× too large) when total
  elements exceed 32K
  ([#177116](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/177116))
- `torch.multinomial` crashes with SIGSEGV on MPS for larger tensors
  ([#178579](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/178579))
- `uint16/uint32/uint64` binary ops produce garbage values
- `ComplexFloat` dtype not supported at all

For an ASR/FA pipeline, silent attention bugs mean **wrong transcriptions and
wrong alignments with no error**. This is arguably worse than a crash.

### Performance on Apple Silicon

Academic benchmarking ([arxiv:2511.05502](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05502))
found that for LLM inference on Apple Silicon:
- **MLX** achieves highest throughput (~230 tok/s)
- **llama.cpp** excels for single-stream inference
- **PyTorch MPS** ranked last among 5 frameworks tested (~7–9 tok/s)
- PyTorch MPS "remains limited by memory constraints on large models"

For Whisper specifically, OpenAI Whisper PR #382 found MPS was **slower than
CPU** on Apple Silicon (5.25s vs 3.26s). The `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK`
path was "20× slower than CPU alone" because unsupported ops bounce between
GPU and CPU with expensive data transfers.

### Apple's response

- Apple engineer `@jhavukainen` is tagged on PyTorch MPS deadlock issues
  (#144634, #162872) but responses have been limited to "I'll need to consult
  a colleague."
- Apple's own `tensorflow-metal` plugin had GPU hangup issues; v0.5.1 fixed
  "multiple memory leak issues leading to GPU hangups." Users reported
  `IOGPUDevice::new_resource: PID likely leaking IOGPUResource (count=200000)`.
- macOS Sequoia added native non-contiguous tensor support in Metal,
  fixing a class of silent correctness bugs. Later macOS releases
  introduced Metal 4 with `MTLTensor`, but no stability improvements
  for ML compute workloads were announced.
- The GPU watchdog timer that kills long compute is by design; there is no
  official mechanism to disable it.

### Current device selection per module

| Module | Device order | Dtype |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| `fa.py` (Whisper FA) | CUDA → CPU | CUDA: float16; CPU: float32 |
| `fa.py` (Wave2Vec FA) | CUDA → CPU | float32 |
| `asr.py` (Whisper ASR) | CUDA → CPU | CUDA: float16; CPU: float32 |
| `speaker.py` | CUDA → CPU | — |
| `_main.py` (serving) | — | GPU profile = concurrent on CUDA only; sequential on CPU |

### Worker concurrency impact

GPU-profile workers previously used `ThreadPoolExecutor(gpu_thread_pool_size)`
for concurrent inference, relying on PyTorch releasing the GIL during GPU
kernels. On CPU, this causes thread oversubscription: each thread's PyTorch ops
use all cores via OpenMP, so 4 threads × 24 cores = 96 threads fighting for 24
cores on net's M3 Ultra.

Fix: GPU-profile workers now serve sequentially on CPU (one request at a time,
all cores per request). `gpu_thread_pool_size` in `server.yaml` takes effect
only when CUDA is available.

### Implications for platform strategy

MPS exclusion means Apple Silicon machines run all ML inference on CPU.
On Apple Silicon (e.g. an M3 Ultra Mac Studio), Whisper, Wav2Vec2, and
Stanza all run on CPU; cache/temp-space pressure can dominate host
behavior on long jobs.

The code is CUDA-ready: all model loaders select CUDA first when
available, `gpu_thread_pool_size` activates, and the worker profiles
are designed for GPU concurrency. A Linux + NVIDIA-GPU deployment
restores GPU acceleration, enables concurrent GPU serving, supports
float16/bfloat16 inference, runs Pyannote speaker diarization on GPU,
and eliminates the MPS-related complexity below.

## Hardware Limitations

Metal (Apple's GPU framework) does **not** support:

| Type | Status | PyTorch behavior |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **bfloat16** | Not in Metal spec | Crashes, wrong results, or `TypeError` depending on operation |
| **float64** | Not in Metal spec | `TypeError: Cannot convert Double to MPS` |
| **int64** | Not in Metal spec | Crashes on some ops (e.g. `abs_out_mps`) |
| **complex128** | Not in Metal spec | Conversion failure |

These are hardware/framework limitations, not PyTorch bugs. No fix is expected.

## Per-Module Workarounds

### ASR — Whisper (`inference/asr.py`)

```python
if device.type == "mps":
    asr_dtype = torch.float32   # not bfloat16
```

Whisper ASR uses `bfloat16` on CUDA for speed. On MPS, this crashes with Metal
assertion failures. We force `float32`. A second fallback path also forces
`float32` on MPS for older transformers versions that don't accept `bfloat16`
at all.

The HuggingFace Transformers Whisper pipeline requires
`attn_implementation="eager"` on MPS — the SDPA attention path broke MPS in
transformers v4.40.0.

### Forced Alignment — Whisper FA (`inference/fa.py`)

```python
if device.type == "mps":
    torch_dtype = torch.float32   # not float16
```

Same pattern as ASR. Whisper FA uses `float16` on CUDA, `float32` on MPS/CPU.

### Forced Alignment — Wave2Vec FA (`inference/fa.py`)

```python
model = bundle.get_model()
if device.type == "mps":
    model = model.float()  # Force float32
model = model.to(device)
```

The torchaudio `MMS_FA` bundle's default parameters can include bfloat16 ops
on MPS. Under concurrent load with large audio files (200+ MB video → WAV →
inference), this causes worker crashes that surface as `Broken pipe (os error
32)`. The `.float()` call converts all parameters to float32 before moving to
device.

### Speaker Diarization (`inference/speaker.py`)

```python
return "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
```

MPS is excluded from diarization because:

- **Pyannote on MPS** produces wrong timestamps
  ([pyannote/pyannote-audio#1337](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/issues/1337),
  closed as wontfix). Kernel crashes also reported on M4
  ([#1886](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/issues/1886)).
- **NeMo** is CUDA-only by design — no MPS support at all.

The device selector (`_device_for_speaker_runtime`) returns `"cuda"` or
`"cpu"`, never `"mps"`.

### Device Policy (`device.py`)

The `BATCHALIGN_FORCE_CPU` environment variable (or `DevicePolicy(force_cpu=True)`)
forces all model loaders onto CPU. This is the escape hatch when MPS causes
problems that dtype coercion alone can't fix.

## Memory Issues on MPS

MPS has well-documented memory management problems:

- **Memory leaks** during inference: usage climbs steadily, eventually OOM
  ([pytorch/pytorch#154329](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/154329),
  [#145374](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/145374))
- **OOM with memory available**: MPS cache doesn't release when it should
  ([pytorch/pytorch#105839](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/105839))
- **`sysinfo::available_memory()`** on macOS undercounts — reports only
  free + purgeable, missing reclaimable file cache. On net (256 GB, heavy I/O),
  this can underreport by tens of GB. No fix exists because macOS doesn't
  expose a `MemAvailable` equivalent like Linux.

**Mitigations:**
- `torch.mps.empty_cache()` — call periodically during long-running inference
- `PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0` — disables MPS memory limit (risks
  system instability, not recommended for production)
- Our Rust server's memory gate uses `sysinfo::available_memory()` with a
  configurable threshold (default 2048 MB, `0` to disable). Idle worker bypass
  prevents deadlock when loaded workers hold RAM.

## Upstream Issues to Track

Check these periodically. If an issue is resolved, we may be able to remove
the corresponding workaround.

### bfloat16

| Issue | Status | What to do if fixed |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| [pytorch/pytorch#141864](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/141864) | Closed (won't fix) | N/A — Metal lacks native bfloat16. Would require Apple hardware/firmware change. |
| [pytorch/pytorch#136624](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/136624) | Closed | Specific to `torch.arange`; the broader bfloat16 gap remains. |
| [pytorch/pytorch#104191](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/104191) | Closed | Specific to `torch.embedding`. |

**Verdict:** bfloat16 on MPS will not be fixed. Our float32 workarounds are permanent.

## Checklist for New Model Loaders

When adding a new inference module that loads a PyTorch model:

1. **Never use MPS.** Our standard device selection is CUDA > CPU. MPS is
   permanently excluded due to kernel-level deadlocks.
2. **Use `force_cpu_preferred()` as the first check** — respect the operator's
   CPU override.
3. **Test device selection** — add a parametrized test with
   `(force_cpu, cuda_available, mps_available)` that verifies MPS availability
   is ignored and CPU is selected when CUDA is unavailable.
4. **Use `float16` on CUDA, `float32` on CPU** — unless the model specifically
   requires a different dtype.

## Test Coverage

Device selection is covered by parametrized tests that verify MPS is ignored
and CPU is selected when CUDA is unavailable:

| Test | File | What it verifies |
|------|------|-----------------|
| `test_load_whisper_fa_selects_device_and_dtype` | `tests/pipelines/fa/test_fa_inference.py` | Whisper FA: CPU when MPS-only, float16 on CUDA, float32 on CPU |
| `test_load_wave2vec_fa_selects_expected_device` | `tests/pipelines/fa/test_fa_inference.py` | Wave2Vec FA: CPU when MPS-only |
| `test_load_wave2vec_fa_forces_float32_on_mps` | `tests/pipelines/fa/test_fa_inference.py` | Wave2Vec FA: no MPS-specific `.float()` needed (MPS excluded) |
| `test_load_whisper_asr_ignores_mps_and_applies_cantonese_overrides` | `tests/pipelines/asr/test_asr_inference.py` | ASR: CPU when MPS available, Cantonese config still applied |
| `TestGpuHasCudaDevice` (4 tests) | `tests/test_worker_serving_mode.py` | CUDA detection helper: force_cpu interaction |
| `TestServingModeSelection` (6 tests) | `tests/test_worker_serving_mode.py` | GPU profile: sequential on CPU, concurrent on CUDA only |
| Speaker device selection test | `tests/pipelines/speaker/test_speaker_inference.py` | Speaker: CUDA > CPU, MPS never selected |
