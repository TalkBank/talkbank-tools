# Number Expansion

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-04-26 19:26 EDT

ASR engines emit digit-bearing tokens (`"3"`, `"$5"`, `"1950s"`,
`"3rd"`, `"80%"`) that the CHAT format does not allow on the main
tier for most languages (the validator rejects them as **E220**).
Number expansion rewrites those tokens to language-appropriate word
forms before they reach validation.

## What expansion does to your output

| Input token | Output (language) |
|------------|--------------------|
| `"3"` (eng) | `"three"` |
| `"3"` (mal — Malayalam) | `"മൂന്ന്"` |
| `"3"` (zho / cmn) | `"三"` |
| `"3"` (jpn / yue) | `"三"` (traditional script) |
| `"3rd"` (eng) | `"third"` |
| `"21st"` (eng) | `"twenty-first"` |
| `"1950s"` (eng) | `"nineteen fifties"` |
| `"$12"` (any) | `"twelve dollars"` |
| `"€50"` (any) | `"fifty euros"` |
| `"80%"` (eng) | `"eighty percent"` |
| `"21-22"` (eng) | `"twenty-one twenty-two"` |
| `"3"` (cym / vie / nan / min / hak) | `"3"` (validator allows digits inline) |

Expansion is fully deterministic — no ML model, no audio context.
A bug-for-bug repeat of the same ASR output produces the same
expanded text.

## Coverage

47 languages have a number-expansion table:

- **43 codegenned from Python `num2words`** at build time
  (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch,
  the Scandinavian languages, Turkish, Russian, Polish, Czech, Thai,
  Telugu, Bengali, Kannada, Indonesian, etc.).
- **4 hand-curated** because `num2words` lacks them or has known
  defects: Malayalam (`mal`), Greek (`ell`), Basque (`eus`),
  Croatian (`hrv`).

CJK languages route through the dedicated `num2chinese` converter
(Mandarin → simplified, Cantonese / Japanese → traditional).

Languages whose CHAT validator already accepts inline digits
(Welsh `cym`, Vietnamese `vie`, Min Nan `nan`, `min`, `hak`) skip
expansion — the digit is left as-is because no E220 violation will
occur.

Languages outside this set hit the validator as E220. To add one,
see the [Adding Language Support](../developer/adding-language-support.md)
checklist's number-expansion section.

## English-specific extras

Beyond cardinals (every covered language), English also has:

- **Ordinals**: `"3rd"` → `"third"`, `"21st"` → `"twenty-first"`,
  `"1234th"` → `"one thousand two hundred and thirty-fourth"`.
- **Decades**: `"1950s"` → `"nineteen fifties"`, `"80s"` → `"eighties"`.
- **Years** (when surrounded by year-form context): handled by the
  ordinal/year/decade composer.

These English-only modes are deterministic Rust composition rules
cross-validated against `num2words` output for every value in the
covered range.

Other languages with ordinal or decade ASR output (Spanish `"3º"`,
German `"3."`, French `"1950s"`) currently pass the digit through —
no observed production traffic has needed them. File a request if
your corpus contains them; the implementation pattern is identical
to English.

## Currency, percent, and dash ranges

These are **language-agnostic** symbol patterns, expanded by Rust
regardless of target language:

- `$ € £ ¥ ₹ ₩ ₽` prefix or suffix → cardinal expansion of the
  digit portion + English currency word ("dollars", "euros",
  "pounds", …). Rationale: morphosyntax can re-tag in-language
  later; CHAT just needs *some* non-digit word.
- `%` suffix → cardinal + per-language percent word
  (English "percent", Spanish "por ciento", etc.); falls back to
  "percent" for unlisted languages.
- `5-7` or `5—6` → split into `"five seven"` / `"five six"` (em-dashes
  normalize to hyphens; both parts must be pure digits).

## When expansion fails

If a token genuinely cannot be expanded — language outside the
registry, ordinal/decade in a non-English language, table cannot
decompose a 6-digit number — the original digit string passes
through. Validation later emits **E220** with the file and line
number. That is the design: silent fallthrough surfaces as a real
validator error rather than a wrong-but-plausible word.
