# %wor Tier Specification

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-04-09 14:59 EDT

How main tier words map to the %wor (word-level timing) dependent tier.

## Overview

The %wor tier is a **flat** list of words, each optionally paired with a
timing bullet. It mirrors the main tier's spoken word slots in the same
order, providing word-level audio timestamps. Unlike the main tier, %wor
never contains groups, annotations, replacements, events, pauses, or any
nested structure.

```
*CHI:    I want cookies .
%wor:    I 1000_1200 want 1200_1400 cookies 1400_1800 .
```

## Correspondence to the Main Tier

`%wor` is a **timing-annotation tier** — it records word-level start/end
timestamps for tokens with a known phoneme sequence. It is NOT a structural
1-to-1 mirror of all main-tier content.

Both the forced alignment word extraction (`collect_fa_words`) and the `%wor`
generation (`generate_wor_tier`) walk the main tier AST identically,
applying the same alignability rules (`TierDomain::Wor`). Any token excluded
by these rules has no `%wor` slot and receives no timing bullet.

There is no CLAN-level positional indexing into `%wor`; `%wor` indices carry
no external semantics beyond tracking which word received which timing.

## What Text Appears in %wor

The %wor tier uses each word's **`cleaned_text`** as display text — the
spoken slot remains the original main-tier word, but the rendered token has
CHAT-specific prosodic markup removed:

| Main tier | cleaned_text (in %wor) | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| `a::n` | `an` | Lengthening `:` removed |
| `hel^lo` | `hello` | Syllable pause `^` removed |
| `som(e)thing` | `something` | Shortening expanded |
| `°softer°` | `softer` | CA delimiters removed |
| `⌈word⌉` | `word` | Overlap points removed |
| `&-uh` | `uh` | Category prefix `&-` stripped (filler — included) |
| `&+fr` | (excluded) | Fragment — excluded from `%wor` |
| `&~um` | (excluded) | Nonword — excluded from `%wor` |
| `xxx` | (excluded) | Untranscribed — no phoneme sequence to align |
| `ice+cream` | `icecream` | Compound marker `+` removed |

## Inclusion Rules

### Words INCLUDED in %wor

The %wor tier includes spoken main-tier word tokens:

| Form | Example | In %wor? | cleaned_text |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Regular words | `want`, `cookie` | Yes | `want`, `cookie` |
| Fillers | `&-uh`, `&-um` | **Yes** | `uh`, `um` |
| Fragments | `&+fr`, `&+w` | **No** | — |
| Nonwords | `&~gaga`, `&~um` | **No** | — |
| Untranscribed placeholders | `xxx`, `yyy`, `www` | **No** | — |
| Words with error marks | `goed [*]` | Yes | `goed` |
| Words inside retrace groups | `<I want> [/] I need` | Yes (all 4 words) | `I`, `want`, `I`, `need` |
| Words inside reformulation groups | `<I want> [//] I need` | Yes (all 4 words) | `I`, `want`, `I`, `need` |
| Words inside quotations | `+"/.` ... `+".` | Yes | word text |
| Words inside phonological groups | `[pho]` | Yes | word text |
| Words inside special form groups | `[sin]` | Yes | word text |

### Words EXCLUDED from %wor

| Form | Example | Why excluded |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Omitted words** | `0is`, `0det` | Never spoken (`WordCategory::Omission`) |
| **CA-style omissions** | `(word)` in CA mode | Never spoken (`WordCategory::CAOmission`) |
| **Untranscribed placeholders** | `xxx`, `yyy`, `www` | No alignable phoneme sequence; CTC alignment cannot produce timings for unknown material |
| **Fragments** | `&+fr`, `&+w` | Incomplete phoneme sequences; FA engine cannot reliably anchor partial phonological material (matches batchalign2 policy) |
| **Nonwords** | `&~gaga`, `&~um` | Interactional/gestural sounds without stable lexical phoneme content (matches batchalign2 policy) |
| **Timing tokens** | `100_200` | %wor metadata artifacts, not lexical content |
| **Empty words** | (parser artifacts) | `cleaned_text` is empty string |

### Non-word items that never appear in %wor

These main tier elements are not words and are simply skipped during tree
traversal:

- **Pauses**: `(.)`, `(..)`, `(...)`, `(2.5)`
- **Events / actions**: `&=laughs`, `0 [=! vocalizes]`
- **Internal bullets**: timing markers between words
- **Linkers**: `++`, `+<`, `+^`, etc.
- **Postcodes**: `[+ text]`, `[+bch]`
- **Tag separators**: `,`, `‡`, `„`
- **Utterance-level annotations**: language codes `[- spa]`, etc.

## Replacement Words (`[: ...]`)

For words with replacement annotations (`original [: replacement]`):

**The ORIGINAL spoken word appears in %wor**, not the replacement. The
replacement does not create a new `%wor` slot or replace the spoken one.

```
*CHI:    what's is dis [: this] ?
%wor:    what's 1000_1200 is 1200_1400 dis 1400_1600 ?
```

This means `%wor` follows the spoken surface slot, while `%mor` continues to
follow the editorial replacement.

### Fragment / nonword with replacement

Fragments and nonwords are excluded from `%wor` even when they carry a
replacement. The replacement matters for `%mor`, but the original token
category (fragment or nonword) governs `%wor` membership:

```
*CHI:    &+fr [: friend] is here .
%wor:    is 1200_1400 here 1400_1800 .
         (fragment excluded regardless of replacement)
```

Untranscribed placeholders (`xxx`, `yyy`, `www`) are similarly excluded from
`%wor` even when they carry a replacement:

```
*CHI:    xxx [: something] is here .
%wor:    is 1200_1400 here 1400_1800 .
         (xxx excluded — no phoneme sequence regardless of replacement)
```

### Omission with replacement

If an omission (`0word`) has a replacement, the omission is still excluded
(the replacement does not rescue it):

```
*CHI:    0gonna [: going+to] eat .
         (omission — not in %wor regardless of replacement)
```

## Retrace and Reformulation Groups

Retraced and reformulated content (`<...> [/]`, `<...> [//]`, `<...> [///]`,
`<...> [/?]`) **IS included** in %wor.

This differs from %mor, where retraced content is excluded. Retrace ancestry
does **not** change `%wor` membership: the same spoken-token rule applies both
inside and outside retrace.

- **%mor** = linguistic/morphological analysis → retraced words are
  corrected speech, not linguistically intended
- **%wor** = word-level audio timing → retraced words were phonologically
  produced and occupy audio time, but they do not receive any special token
  class promotion or demotion

```
*CHI:    <I want> [/] I need cookie .
%wor:    I 100_200 want 200_400 I 500_600 need 600_800 cookie 800_1200 .
```

Both `collect_fa_words()` and `generate_wor_tier()` descend into retrace
content and then apply the same `%wor` word-membership rules to the leaves.

## Timing Bullet Format

Each word may optionally have a timing bullet:

```
word \u0015start_ms_end_ms\u0015
```

Where:
- `\u0015` is the Unicode control character U+0015 (NAK), used as the CHAT
  bullet delimiter
- `start_ms` and `end_ms` are unsigned integers representing milliseconds
- Words without timing simply appear without a following bullet

Example raw encoding:
```
%wor:    hello \u00150_500\u0015 world \u0015500_1000\u0015 .
```

Words CAN lack timing bullets — this means timing is unknown, NOT an error.

## Tier-Level Structure

A complete %wor tier has:

```
%wor:\t[- lang_code] word1 [bullet1] word2 [bullet2] ... terminator [utterance_bullet]
```

| Component | Required | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Language code | No | Inherited from main tier's `[- code]` |
| Words | Yes | Flat list of cleaned_text values |
| Timing bullets | No | Per-word, optional |
| Terminator | Yes | Same as main tier (`.`, `?`, `!`, `+...`, etc.) |
| Utterance bullet | No | Span of entire utterance (first word start to last word end) |

## Generation Pipeline

1. **Forced alignment engines** extract `%wor` word slots from the main tier
   AST via `collect_fa_words()`
2. The FA model processes the audio and returns per-word `[start_ms,
   end_ms]` pairs (or `null` for unaligned words)
3. Timings are injected back into the AST via
   `inject_timings_for_utterance()`, stored on each word's
   `timing_alignment` field
4. Post-processing (`postprocess_utterance_timings`) chains end times (in
   non-pauses mode) and **conditionally** clamps word timings to the utterance
   bullet range. Clamping only applies when BOTH conditions hold: the bullet is
   `BulletSource::Authoritative` (not a runtime UTR hint) AND a `%wor` tier
   already exists (indicating this is a re-alignment, not a first-time run).
   On first-time alignment — e.g., after `transcribe` + `utseg` — no clamping
   occurs, because the utterance bullet came from narrow ASR-derived timestamps
   that may not cover the full speech span. See
   [Word timing clamping policy](forced-alignment.md#word-timing-clamping-policy)
   for the full rationale.
5. `MainTier::generate_wor_tier()` walks the AST one final time, collecting
   each spoken word slot's `cleaned_text` and `timing_alignment` into a flat
   `WorTier`
6. The `WorTier` is serialized via `WriteChat` into the `%wor:\t...` line

Steps 1 and 5 both use the same `%wor` membership rules (`TierDomain::Wor`),
guaranteeing identical traversal order. The `%wor` word count equals the
number of Wor-domain words (regular words and fillers) — NOT a count of
all main-tier tokens. Fragments, nonwords, and untranscribed placeholders
are not counted.
