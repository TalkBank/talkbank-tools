# align

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-08-31 07:54 EDT

Add word-level and utterance-level timestamps to an existing CHAT transcript
by running forced alignment against the corresponding audio file.

**Requires:** a `.cha` file whose `@Media` header names an audio file visible
to the server (or to the local daemon). See
[Media Resolution](../../reference/command-io.md#1-align).

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Align one file in place
batchalign3 align file.cha

# Cantonese / other non-RevAI languages: choose a compatible UTR backend explicitly
batchalign3 align yue_file.cha --utr-engine whisper

# Align a corpus directory, writing results to a separate output directory
batchalign3 align corpus/ -o aligned/

# Audio lives in a different directory from the .cha files
batchalign3 align transcripts/ -o out/ --media-dir /path/to/audio/

# Align a curated list of files against a remote server
batchalign3 --server http://your-server:8001 align --file-list rerun.txt
```

---

## Pipeline

`align` is **FA-first**. It does not always need utterance timing recovery
(UTR), and the selected UTR backend only matters when the parsed CHAT file
actually contains untimed utterances.

In practice that means:

- fully timed files can skip UTR entirely and go straight to FA
- partially timed or untimed files may require UTR before FA
- backend/language errors should be read as “this file needs UTR, and the
  selected UTR backend cannot support it”, not as “forced alignment itself is
  unavailable for this language”

The diagram below shows how CLI flags control the alignment pipeline at
runtime. Source: `crates/batchalign/src/runner/dispatch/`.

### Validation model

`align` uses staged validation:

1. request-shape validation
   Invalid path-mode shapes, malformed flags, and incompatible option payloads
   fail immediately.
2. file-state inspection
   After parsing the CHAT file, Batchalign inspects whether the file is already
   timed well enough to skip UTR.
3. stage-specific backend validation
   If the file needs UTR, Batchalign validates the selected UTR backend against
   the file's language before running timing recovery.

This is why `--utr-engine` matters for some files but is irrelevant for others.

### UTR strategy selection (Auto disabled)

When `--utr-strategy auto` (the default), the strategy is currently
always `GlobalUtr` regardless of file content or language. The
previous content/language-aware auto-routing (which auto-picked
`TwoPassOverlapUtr` for English files containing `+<` or `⌊` markers)
was disabled 2026-03-30, see the inline comment in the `Auto` arm of
`resolve_strategy()` at
`crates/batchalign/src/runner/dispatch/utr.rs`. Two-pass overlap-aware
recovery is reachable only via the explicit `--utr-strategy two-pass`
override.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    auto(["--utr-strategy auto\n(default)"]) --> always_global["GlobalUtr\n(monotonic single-pass)"]
    explicit_global(["--utr-strategy global"]) --> force_global["GlobalUtr\n(explicit override)"]
    explicit_two(["--utr-strategy two-pass"]) --> force_two["TwoPassOverlapUtr\n(explicit override)"]
```

Why Auto was disabled: an operator reported alignment regressions on
real files; investigation found that `enforce_monotonicity()` only
checks start times, not end times, so overlapping utterance bullets
go uncorrected. The two-pass tuning was also based on only four
corpora and not broadly validated. The previously-measured gains
under that mechanism (English: +4.3pp SBCSAE, +3.8pp Jefferson;
non-English on Hakka/Welsh/German/Serbian: GlobalUtr matched or beat
TwoPassOverlapUtr) are retained here as historical context for the
benchmark numbers that motivated the original gate, not as a
description of current default behavior.

### UTR internals: partial vs full-file ASR

When fewer than 50% of utterances are untimed and audio is longer than 60 s,
`run_utr_pass()` uses partial-window ASR (running ASR only over untimed
regions) rather than a full-file pass.

```mermaid

### Rerun hardening rules

`align` does not blindly trust existing `%wor` timing on reruns. Several
regression-driven safeguards now keep stale timing shapes from being refreshed
back into the output:

1. **Cheap `%wor` reuse is health-checked first.** Existing `%wor` timing is
   reused only when the word distribution already looks plausible. Rerun falls
   back to fresh FA instead of reuse when:
   - any `%wor` word is near-zero (`< 40 ms`)
   - a 3+-word utterance has one `%wor` word consuming more than 40% of the
     utterance span
   - the last `%wor` word already overruns the utterance boundary or other
     reuse-shape invariants fail

2. **Gap healing only bridges small gaps by default.** Under
   `WordGapHealing::Heal`, the default, Batchalign may extend a word to the
   next word's start to remove tiny pauses; pass `--pauses` to keep each
   word's own end instead. Ordinary smoothing only applies to
   plausibly small internal gaps (currently `<= 1000 ms`). Larger gaps are
   treated as real pauses or mistracks and are left visible unless a more
   specific rerun-healing rule applies.

3. **Gap healing treats boundary-sensitive seams specially.** Several
   traced rerun bugs showed that some words already have the right FA timing
   *before* postprocess, then become dominant only after smoothing, while
   others need a targeted heal:
    - merged compound fillers like `&-you_know` are not stretched forward a
      second time after injection merges their split FA parts
    - ordinary lexical words are not stretched into a following timed filler
      span such as `&-um` when that bridge would make the lexical word dominate
      the utterance
    - timed fillers are likewise not stretched across a following pause when
      that smoothing would make the filler itself dominate the utterance
    - a near-zero lexical word may still bridge to the following filler start
      when that heal stays below the same 40% utterance-share plausibility cap
   - if a collapsed lexical word already touches an adjacent word boundary,
     continuous mode may rebalance that shared boundary so the lexical word
     reaches the 40 ms floor without collapsing the neighboring span in turn;
     this now applies when borrowing from either the following word or the
     preceding word, and for both fillers and ordinary lexical words

4. **Rerun clamping is selective.** Fresh FA timings are not clamped to narrow
   provisional UTR hints, and small final-word overruns can heal instead of
   being chopped back to a near-zero tail. This prevents reruns from preserving
   stale narrow bullet windows that were only ever estimates.

5. **Prior-boundary rebuilding is an explicit v0.4.0 research projection.** The
   default `--existing-wor-boundaries preserve` retains the compatibility
   behavior above. `rebuild-from-evidence` instead treats earlier `%wor` and
   main-tier boundaries as revisable output: it keeps admitted word extents and
   rebuilds the main bullet from their minimum/maximum hull. This flag does not
   change FA raw-evidence cache keys and cannot authorize inference. Use it
   with `--require-media-cache` and `--debug-dir` for controlled replay. It can
   reveal real conflicts between adjacent utterance boundaries; a structurally
   wider word hull is not by itself proof that its acoustic boundaries are
   correct.

   This option does not force new evidence resolution. If every utterance
   qualifies for the reusable-`%wor` fast path, rebuild reconstructs main-tier
   bullets from those existing admitted word timings and does not replay raw FA
   cache entries. A controlled raw-evidence comparison must use an input whose
   intended groups actually reach evidence resolution, then confirm each
   sidecar's evidence source.

6. **Cross-speaker end overlap is an explicit v0.4.0 research projection.**
   The default `--end-overlap-policy clamp-all-adjacent` preserves current
   behavior. `preserve-cross-speaker` leaves conversational overlap between
   different speaker codes intact while continuing to clamp same-speaker
   overlap. It does not relax start-order enforcement and does not change raw
   FA cache identity. Treat it as an experimental arm until blinded listening
   evidence supports a wider policy.

7. **Execution shape does not change the declared projection.** The same
   prior-boundary, optional-repair, and end-overlap policies now apply whether
   a run performs fresh injection, reuses every `%wor`, or resolves no FA
   groups. Optional repair always runs before final monotonicity enforcement.
   This is a consistency guarantee, not a recommendation to enable the
   experimental repair flag.

The practical effect is that reruns now prefer **fresh FA over stale reuse**
whenever the old timing distribution already looks suspicious, and postprocess
is more conservative about turning real pauses/fillers into dominant words.

## Options

### Path options (shared with all processing commands)

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PATHS...` | Input `.cha` files or directories |
| `-o`, `--output DIR` | Output directory (omit to overwrite inputs in place) |
| `--file-list FILE` | Read input paths from a text file (one path per line; `#` comments and blank lines ignored) |
| `--in-place` | Explicit in-place flag |

### Alignment options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--media-dir PATH` | alongside `.cha` | Directory to search for audio files matching the `@Media` header stem |
| `--utr-engine {rev,whisper,tencent}` | `rev` | UTR backend; `--help` lists the accepted values. `rev` needs Rev.AI credentials and has no Cantonese support; `whisper` is local; `tencent` covers Chinese variants. A rejection names the engines that would work for the file's language. |
| `--utr-engine-custom NAME` |: | **Deprecated alias for `--utr-engine`**, still honoured, hidden from `--help`. |
| `--utr` / `--no-utr` | enabled | Enable or skip the UTR pre-pass entirely |
| `--utr-strategy {auto,global,two-pass}` | `auto` | Overlap strategy: `auto` currently always returns `GlobalUtr` (the language/content-aware gate was disabled 2026-03-30; see §"UTR strategy selection" above). `two-pass` is the only way to reach `TwoPassOverlapUtr` today. |
| `--utr-fuzzy THRESHOLD` | `0.85` | Jaro-Winkler similarity threshold for word matching. `1.0` = exact only |
| `--utr-ca-markers {enabled,disabled}` | `enabled` | Use CA overlap markers (⌈⌉⌊⌋) to set alignment windows |
| `--utr-density-threshold N` | `0.30` | Max overlap fraction before skipping pass-1 exclusion (0.0-1.0) |
| `--utr-tight-buffer MS` | `500` | Pass-2 tight window buffer in milliseconds |
| `--fa-engine {wav2vec,whisper,cantonese}` | `wav2vec` (reports word start and end; see §"Forced alignment reference") | Forced-alignment model. `cantonese` is the jyutping-preprocessing engine, formerly reachable only as `wav2vec_fa_canto` through the flag below. |
| `--fa-engine-custom NAME` |: | **Deprecated alias for `--fa-engine`**, still honoured, hidden from `--help`. |
| `--wor` / `--nowor` | `--wor` | Include or suppress the `%wor` word-timing tier |
| `--pauses` | off | Preserve each engine-reported word end instead of healing small plausible gaps. For Whisper, it also selects the historical character-spaced text mode. |
| `--existing-wor-boundaries {preserve,rebuild-from-evidence}` | `preserve` | v0.4.0 option controlling how a rerun projects fresh FA evidence when the input already has `%wor`. `preserve` keeps compatibility; the experimental rebuild mode keeps fresh word extents and reconstructs the main bullet from their hull. It is a local projection only and does not change raw-evidence cache identity. |
| `--end-overlap-policy {clamp-all-adjacent,preserve-cross-speaker}` | `clamp-all-adjacent` | v0.4.0 option controlling the later monotonicity projection. The experimental arm preserves cross-speaker overlap but still clamps same-speaker overlap. It does not change raw-evidence cache identity. |
| `--merge-abbrev` | off | Merge abbreviations in the output CHAT |
| `--before PATH` |: | Previous version of the file for incremental alignment (skip unchanged utterances) |
| `--bullet-repair` | off | Post-FA bullet repair for timing violations (experimental) |
| `--review-level {none,low-confidence,all}` | `none` | Legacy compatibility option. All values now leave CHAT free of `%xalign`/`%xrev`; omit it in new scripts. |

## What changes in the `.cha` file

- `%wor` tier added or replaced with word-level timestamps (`word ·start_end·`)
- Utterance-level bullet times (`·start_end·`) updated (see below for how)
- Existing `%mor` and `%gra` tiers are preserved and untouched
- The audio file is read but never modified

### Research evidence without CHAT clutter

`%wor` deliberately stores only display words and timing bullets. It cannot
represent model score, cache/reuse source, or the provenance chain of a timing
that was clamped, derived, or repaired. For an alignment experiment, pass
`--debug-dir DIR`; a successful run then writes
`DIR/<stem>_fa_evidence.json` alongside the ordinary debug artifacts.
For a bare input filename, `<stem>` is the familiar file stem. If the submitted
filename contains directories, Batchalign appends a short digest of that full
identity so equal basenames from different corpus branches cannot overwrite
one another.

Version 0.3.0 writes evidence schema version 2. Version 0.4.0 writes schema
version 3. Both record the selected
engine and build/model version,
the cache key and evidence source for every group (`wor_reuse`, `cache`, or
`inference`), stable word identifiers, pre-injection timings, Wave2Vec-family
model scores when available, complete start/end provenance chains, and every
typed decision that later clamped or removed timing. Those decisions remain in
the JSON while CHAT output contains no review-tier projection. A model
score is evidence emitted by the aligner, **not** a calibrated probability
that a boundary is correct. Schema 3 additionally records stable utterance
ordinals beside the input-AST line indices for numeric monotonicity effects;
this lets a consumer survive an inserted provenance header without attaching
the decision to the preceding utterance. Schema version 3 does not yet record the final
per-word timings after post-processing; use the resulting CHAT for those final
bullets and do not infer a complete repair history from the sidecar.

An enabled evidence dump is fail-closed: if Batchalign cannot create or write
the requested sidecar, the job reports a persistence error instead of silently
finishing without the research artifact.

When untimed utterance recovery uses Rev, the same debug directory also gets
one or more `*_rev_evidence.json` sidecars. They record the exact prepared
media, provider presentation, raw cache key/outcome, request identity, and
named UTR projection revision. A partial-window run keys each filename by its
raw evidence identity so several windows cannot overwrite one another.

### How utterance bullet times are set

Utterance bullet timing goes through two stages and the result depends on
whether this is the file's first alignment or a re-alignment.

**First alignment (UTR → FA):**

1. UTR runs first, setting a provisional timing hint on each untimed utterance.
   These hints are rough estimates, they come from a global DP alignment of
   ASR tokens against transcript words and serve as grouping windows for the FA
   step. They are not written to the output.
2. FA runs within those windows and aligns each word individually.
3. After injection, each utterance bullet is **replaced** with the span derived
   from the FA word timings (first aligned word start → last aligned word end).
   This is the self-healing property: valid FA word timings produce a valid
   utterance bullet by construction, regardless of how accurate the UTR hint was.

**Re-alignment, default `preserve` policy (file already has FA word timings):**

If the file already has utterance bullets set by a previous FA run (or
hand-linked by an annotator), the bullet is **expanded but never shrunk**:

- The new bullet covers `min(word_start, existing_start)` →
  `max(word_end, existing_end)`.
- This preserves timing coverage around fillers (`&-uh`), pauses, gestures
  (`&=laughs`), and other elements that FA cannot align but whose timing was
  already captured in the original bullet.

**Re-alignment, experimental v0.4.0 `rebuild-from-evidence` policy:**

- Admitted word extents are not clamped to the prior authoritative bullet.
- The main bullet is replaced by the exact minimum-start/maximum-end hull of
  the admitted word evidence.
- The raw FA cache key remains unchanged, so a cache-required comparison can
  vary this projection without rerunning the model.
- A later document-order monotonicity pass applies the selected
  `--end-overlap-policy`. The default still clamps any overlap; the research
  arm preserves only cross-speaker overlap. Word-cutting cases remain explicit
  evidence for adjudication; do not equate CHAT validity or word containment
  counts with boundary accuracy.

**FA failure fallback:**

If FA produces no aligned words for an utterance (audio quality too poor,
utterance skipped by the engine), the UTR hint is kept unchanged and written
as the utterance bullet. This is the safe fallback: approximate timing is
better than no timing.

The following diagram shows the decision logic inside
`update_utterance_bullet()` (`fa/mod.rs`):

```mermaid

    start(["After FA word injection"]) --> any_words{"Any FA words\naligned?"}
    any_words -->|No| keep_existing["Keep existing bullet\n(UTR hint or authoritative)"]

    exact_hull --> result
```

## Gotchas

**`@Media: unlinked` is not an error.** `unlinked` means the transcript
exists but utterances have not yet been aligned to timestamps, it is the
normal pre-alignment state. `align` is precisely the command that creates
those links. The audio file is still resolved and used normally.

**Re-aligning an already-aligned file does not shrink utterance bullets under
the default `preserve` policy.**
If an utterance already has a bullet from a previous FA run or from
hand-linking, the new bullet will cover _at least_ as wide a span as the
original. This is intentional: the original bullet may cover fillers,
pauses, and gestures at the edges of the utterance that FA itself cannot
align (because they produce no acoustic signal the aligner recognises).
The union policy ensures that re-running `align` on the same file is safe
and idempotent. The experimental `rebuild-from-evidence` policy deliberately
does not make that guarantee; use it only when testing whether prior boundaries
are stale, with evidence retention and output comparison.

**Audio must be visible to the execution host.** With `--server`, the server
resolves `@Media` against its own filesystem. Paths that are valid on your
machine may not be valid on the server. Use `--media-dir` to point to a
server-visible path, or use the server's `media_mappings` configuration.

**`--utr-strategy global` is the default behavior anyway.** Since the
`auto` routing currently always returns `GlobalUtr` (see §"UTR strategy
selection"), passing `global` explicitly produces identical behavior.
If you see timing regressions and want to try the two-pass overlap-aware
mechanism, use `--utr-strategy two-pass`: that's the only way to
reach it today.

**For large re-run lists**, split the list into batches and submit
each batch as a separate `batchalign3 align --file-list <batch>`
invocation rather than passing thousands of files at once. Each
invocation gets a fresh worker pool, which keeps memory pressure
predictable.
