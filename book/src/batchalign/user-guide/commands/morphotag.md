# morphotag

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-03 08:50 EDT

Add morphosyntactic analysis (`%mor` POS/lemma tiers and `%gra` dependency
tiers) to existing CHAT transcripts. Text-only — no audio involved.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Tag one file in place
batchalign3 morphotag file.cha

# Tag a corpus directory
batchalign3 morphotag corpus/ -o tagged/

# Tag with language override (file has wrong or missing @Languages header)
batchalign3 morphotag file.cha --lang spa

# Retokenize main lines to match UD tokenization (expands contractions)
batchalign3 morphotag corpus/ -o out/ --retokenize

# Use remote server
batchalign3 --server http://your-server:8001 morphotag corpus/ -o out/
```

## Pipeline

All files are batched together through the batched-text-infer pool
(`crates/batchalign/src/runner/dispatch/infer_batched.rs::ReleasedCommand::Morphotag`).
Utterances are pooled across all files, grouped by language, and
dispatched to a Stanza worker per language group with semaphore-bounded
concurrency. Repeated `morphotag` runs on the same input run the full
Stanza pipeline again — text-NLP results are not cached
(`CacheTaskName` at `crates/batchalign/src/chat_ops/cache_key.rs:58`
covers only `ForcedAlignment` and `UtrAsr`).

## Options

### Path options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PATHS...` | Input `.cha` files or directories |
| `-o`, `--output DIR` | Output directory (omit to overwrite in place) |
| `--file-list FILE` | Read input paths from a text file |
| `--in-place` | Explicit in-place flag |

If you combine `--file-list` with in-place processing on a large corpus, do
not expect the `.cha` files on disk to rewrite one by one during the run.
`morphotag` batches and stages text-NLP work internally; the visible in-place
file updates may land only when the current invocation finishes. For long
repair runs where you want output to appear incrementally, split the file list
into smaller chunks and run those chunks sequentially.

### Morphotag options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--lang CODE` | from `@Languages` | 3-letter ISO language code. Overrides the file's `@Languages` header when set |
| `--retokenize` / `--keeptokens` | `--keeptokens` | Retokenize main lines to UD tokenization (may split/merge words), or preserve existing tokenization |
| `--skipmultilang` / `--multilang` | `--multilang` | Skip utterances in non-primary languages, or process all |
| `--lexicon FILE` | — | Comma-separated manual lexicon override file (read on client, injected as typed options) |
| `--merge-abbrev` | off | Merge abbreviations in the output |
| `--no-l2-morphotag` | off | Opt out of L2 dispatch. With this flag, `@s` code-switched words emit `L2\|xxx` placeholders instead of real POS/lemma/deprel annotations (legacy behavior, kept for reproducibility of older analyses) |
| `--no-pos-hints` | off | Opt out of transcriber `$POS` hint respect. By default, after morphotag the pipeline overrides any `%mor` POS that disagrees with the CLAN→UD-mapped hint on main-tier words carrying `$POS` suffixes. Lemma and features from Stanza are preserved. Pass `--no-pos-hints` to skip the override pass and keep Stanza's POS as-is. See [Transcriber `$POS` Hints](../../reference/pos-hints.md) for the mechanism and coverage table |
| `--before PATH` | — | Previous version of the file for incremental processing (skip unchanged utterances) |

## `@Options: CA` files are passed through

Files whose header declares `@Options: CA` (Conversation Analysis mode)
are passed through morphotag unchanged. The pipeline parses the file,
detects the option, and serializes it back as-is — no `%mor` / `%gra`
tiers are added, and any pre-existing `%mor` / `%gra` tiers are
preserved verbatim. Provenance comments are not injected for these
files.

This mirrors how `align` skips files with `@Options: NoAlign`. The
mechanism is the option header alone; per-utterance content (CA
prosody markers, pauses, `&=` events, etc.) does not influence the
decision.

---

## What changes in the `.cha` file

- `%mor` tier added or replaced with POS tags and lemmas per word
- `%gra` tier added or replaced with dependency relations
- Main tier text may be retokenized when `--retokenize` is set
- Special `@Options: dummy` notation is auto-detected and preserved
- No audio is involved; this is a text-only transform

---

## Language routing

When `--lang` is omitted, the language is read from the CHAT file's
`@Languages` header (first declared language). Individual utterances with
a `[- lang]` precode are routed to the appropriate language-specific Stanza
model regardless of the file-level language.

See [Language Routing](../../../architecture/language-and-multilingual/language-routing.md#per-utterance-routing-into-stanza).

## `--retokenize` warning

`--retokenize` allows Stanza to split or merge words on the main tier to match
UD tokenization (e.g. expanding "don't" → "do n't"). This may invalidate
existing `%wor` timing bullets. If the file has already been aligned, re-run
`align` after retokenizing.

## Reading the server log

If you see ``WARN Stripped N Stanza control-token leak(s) ...`` lines
in ``~/.batchalign3/server.log``, those are working-as-designed
signals from a known-upstream-defect workaround firing — not errors.
See the troubleshooting page section
[Stripped N upstream-library warnings](../troubleshooting.md#stripped-n-upstream-library-warnings-in-the-server-log)
for the full explanation and what to do.

## L2 dispatch for code-switched words (default: on)

`@s` (code-switched) words are routed to secondary-language Stanza
models and annotated with real POS tags, lemmas, and dependency
relations — including proper handling of contractions
(`it's@s:eng` → `pron|it~aux|be`) and phrasal verbs
(`wake@s up@s` → `verb|wake part|up` with `COMPOUND-PRT` GRA deprel).
This is the default behavior.

To opt out and emit legacy `L2|xxx` placeholders (e.g. for
reproducibility of older analyses), pass `--no-l2-morphotag`:

```bash
batchalign3 morphotag bilingual.cha --no-l2-morphotag
```

**Validation.** L2 dispatch has been validated at scale: across 19
language pairs and ~17K `@s` words, well above 99% dispatch to a
secondary-language Stanza model on most pairs, with 100% dispatch on
the majority of evaluated language pairs. The remaining cases fall
back to `L2|xxx`.

**Example.** German-English code-switching:

```
*EVA:   was ich jetzt machen möchte ist film@s studies@s .
%mor:   ... noun|film noun|study-Plur .     ← default (L2 dispatch on)
%mor:   ... L2|xxx L2|xxx .                 ← with --no-l2-morphotag
```
