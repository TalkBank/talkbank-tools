# Headers

Headers are lines beginning with `@` that provide metadata about the transcript. They appear between `@Begin` and the first utterance (though some headers like `@Comment` can appear anywhere).

## Required Headers

### @UTF8

Must be the very first line of every CHAT file. Declares UTF-8 encoding.

```chat
@UTF8
```

### @Begin / @End

Mark the start and end of the transcript body. Every CHAT file must have exactly one `@Begin` and one `@End`.

### @Participants

Declares all speakers in the transcript. Format: `CODE Name Role`, comma-separated.

```chat
@Participants:	CHI Target_Child, MOT Mother, FAT Father
```

Speaker codes are three-letter uppercase identifiers. Common codes:
- `CHI` — target child
- `MOT` — mother
- `FAT` — father
- `INV` — investigator
- `OBS` — observer

### @ID

Provides detailed metadata for each participant. One `@ID` line per participant.

```chat
@ID:	eng|corpus|CHI|2;6.||||Target_Child|||
```

Fields (pipe-separated): language, corpus, speaker code, age, sex, group, SES, participant role, education, custom field.

Age format: `years;months.days` (e.g., `2;6.` = 2 years, 6 months).

SES field: ethnicity (`White`, `Black`, `Asian`, `Latino`, `Pacific`, `Native`, `Multiple`, `Unknown`), socioeconomic code (`UC`, `MC`, `WC`, `LI`), or combined with comma separator (e.g., `White,MC`).

## Optional Headers

### @Languages

Declares the language(s) used in the transcript.

```chat
@Languages:	eng, fra
```

### @Date

Recording date in DD-MON-YYYY format.

```chat
@Date:	15-JAN-2024
```

### @Location

Where the recording took place.

```chat
@Location:	Boston, MA, USA
```

### @Situation

Description of the recording context.

```chat
@Situation:	free play with toys in lab
```

### @Activities

Activities during the recording.

```chat
@Activities:	toyplay, reading
```

### @Comment

Free-form comments. Can appear anywhere in the file (before, between, or after utterances).

```chat
@Comment:	child was tired during this session
```

### @Media

Links the transcript to an audio or video file.

```chat
@Media:	session01, audio
```

### @Transcriber / @Coder

Identifies who created or coded the transcript.

```chat
@Transcriber:	JDS
@Coder:	ABC
```

## Header Ordering

Headers should follow this conventional order:
1. `@UTF8` (required, first line)
2. `@Begin` (required)
3. `@Languages`
4. `@Participants` (required)
5. `@ID` lines (one per participant)
6. Other metadata headers (`@Date`, `@Location`, etc.)
7. `@Comment` lines (can also appear later)

## Validation

The parser validates header structure including:
- `@UTF8` must be the first non-empty line
- `@Begin` and `@End` are required and must appear exactly once
- `@Participants` is required and must declare all speakers used in utterances
- `@ID` participant codes must match `@Participants` declarations
- Age format validation in `@ID` lines
