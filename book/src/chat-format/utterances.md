# Utterances

An utterance is the fundamental unit of a CHAT transcript. It consists of a main tier (the transcribed speech) followed by zero or more dependent tiers (annotations).

## Main Tier

The main tier begins with `*SPEAKER:` followed by a tab and the utterance content, ending with a terminator.

```chat
*CHI:	I want a cookie .
```

### Speaker Codes

Speaker codes are three uppercase letters matching a code declared in `@Participants`:

```chat
@Participants:	CHI Target_Child, MOT Mother
*MOT:	what do you want ?
*CHI:	cookie .
```

### Terminators

Every utterance must end with a terminator:

| Terminator | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `.` | Declarative (period) |
| `?` | Question |
| `!` | Exclamation |
| `+...` | Trailing off |
| `+/.` | Interruption |
| `+//.` | Self-interruption |
| `+/?` | Interrupted question |
| `+!?` | Broken question |
| `+".` | Quotation follows on next line |

### Line Continuation

Long utterances wrap to the next line with a leading tab:

```chat
*MOT:	well I think that we should probably go to
	the store and get some more cookies .
```

## Content Items

The content between `*SPEAKER:` and the terminator consists of content items separated by whitespace:

- **Words** — regular words, potentially with annotations
- **Groups** — bracketed content like `<word word>` for overlap, retrace, etc.
- **Special forms** — pauses `(.)`, events `&=laughs`, fillers `&-uh`
- **Separators** — commas `,` and other punctuation

### Words

Words are the primary content unit. See [Word Syntax](word-syntax.md) for full details.

### Groups

Angle brackets `< >` group words for annotations:

```chat
*CHI:	<I want> [/] I want cookie .
```

Common group annotations:
- `[/]` — retrace (exact repetition)
- `[//]` — retrace with correction
- `[///]` — reformulation
- `[/-]` — false start
- `[?]` — uncertain transcription

### Special Forms

```chat
*CHI:	um (.) I want &-uh cookie .
```

- `(.)` — short pause
- `(..)` — medium pause
- `(...)` — long pause
- `(1.5)` — timed pause in seconds
- `&=laughs` — paralinguistic event
- `&-uh` — filler

## Media Linking

Utterances can include media timestamps (bullets) that link to audio/video:

```chat
*CHI:	I want cookies . 1234_5678
```

The numbers represent start and end times in milliseconds.

## Dependent Tiers

See [Dependent Tiers](dependent-tiers.md) for documentation on `%mor`, `%gra`, `%pho`, `%wor`, and other annotation tiers that follow the main tier.
