# COMPOUND -- Normalize Compound Word Formatting

## Purpose

Reimplements CLAN's COMPOUND command, which normalizes compound word notation in CHAT files. In CHAT, compound words are joined with `+` (e.g., `ice+cream`). This command converts dash-joined compounds to the canonical plus notation.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan compound file.cha
```

## Options

COMPOUND has no command-specific flags — only the input `path`
positional and the optional shared `-o`/`--output` (default: stdout).
The dash→plus normalization is unconditional: there is no
`--dash-to-plus` switch in the current CLI.

## Behavior

The transform walks all main-tier word nodes and converts dash-joined compounds to plus notation (e.g., `ice-cream` becomes `ice+cream`).

Operations performed:

- Normalize dash-joined compounds to plus notation: `ice-cream` -> `ice+cream`
- Preserves filler prefixes (`&-uh`) and omission prefixes (`0word`)
- Only converts when all parts are purely alphabetic

The transform recurses into annotated words, replacement forms, groups, and annotated groups.

## Differences from CLAN

- Operates on AST rather than raw text.
- Uses the framework transform pipeline (parse -> transform -> serialize -> write).
