# DSS -- Developmental Sentence Scoring

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-27 10:41 EDT

## Purpose

Assigns point values to utterances based on grammatical complexity, using a configurable rule file that defines pattern-matching rules for morphosyntactic categories. DSS is a clinical tool developed by Laura Lee and Susan Canter for evaluating children's grammatical development by scoring complete sentences on eight grammatical categories.

Scoring requires a `%mor` dependent tier on each utterance. Utterances without `%mor` are silently skipped.

See the [CLAN manual](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CLAN.html#DSS_Command) for the original DSS command specification and the full rule set.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan dss --speaker CHI file.cha
chatter clan dss --rules english.scr file.cha
chatter clan dss --max-utterances 100 file.cha
chatter clan dss --format json file.cha
```

## Options (chatter-native)

| Option | CLAN flag | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `--speaker <CODE>` | `+t*CHI` (or `+tCHI`) | Include speaker |
| `--exclude-speaker <CODE>` | `-t*CHI` (or `-tCHI`) | Exclude speaker |
| `--rules <PATH>` | `+lF` | Custom DSS rules file (.scr) |
| `--max-utterances <N>` | `+cN` | Maximum utterances to score (default: 50) |
| `--gem <LABEL>` | `+g"label"` | Restrict to gem segment |
| `--range <START-END>` | `+z25-125` | Utterance range |
| `--id-filter <PATTERN>` | `+t@ID="..."` | Filter by @ID pattern |
| `--include-retracings` | `+r6` | Include retraced words in counting |
| `--format <FMT>` | -- | Output format: clan (default), text, json, csv |

## CLAN `+`-flag coverage audit

Authoritative enumeration of every CLAN `dss` flag. Sources:

* `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/dss.cpp` — `usage()`.
* `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/cutt.cpp` — `mainusage()` DSS branches.
* `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs` — chatter's rewriter.
* `crates/talkbank-cli/src/cli/args/clan_commands.rs::Dss` plus
  `clan_common.rs::CommonAnalysisArgs`.

(Status legend: same as [FREQ](./freq.md#status-legend).)

DSS is a **required-flag refusal** command in chatter — same
refusal byte-parity as EVAL/KIDEVAL/IPSYN/SUGAR.

### DSS-specific `+`-flags (from `dss.cpp::usage`)

| CLAN flag | Meaning | Chatter | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `+aN` | Debug DSS rules level N (1–3) | — | Missing | Rule-tracing diagnostic. |
| `+cN` | Analyse N complete unique utterances (default 50) | `--max-utterances N` | Done | Rewriter routes `+cN` → `--max-utterances N` via the shared `(b'+', b'c') if matches!(subcommand, Ipsyn \| Dss)` arm in `clan_args.rs` (the existing IPSYN routing covers DSS too). Audit row flipped from Partial → Done 2026-05-27. |
| `+d` | Output in spreadsheet format | — | Missing | `OSX-CLAN/src/clan/dss.cpp:2520` sets `IsOutputSpreadsheet = 1` for bare `+d`. chatter has no `--format csv` for DSS. Per-DSS rewriter arm in `clan_args.rs` passes the token through so clap reports the literal `+d` argument rather than the misleading `--display-mode` rewrite. |
| `+d1` | Spreadsheet format with one TOTAL line per file | — | Missing | Same `dss.cpp:2520` switch sets `IsOutputSpreadsheet = 2` for `+d1`. Per-DSS rewriter arm passes the token through. |
| `+lF` | Specify language script file `F` (eng, engu, bss, jpn) | `--rules <PATH>` | Done | Same rewriter-routing gap as IPSYN. |

### Audit summary

| Bucket | Count |
|---|---|
| Done | 6 |
| Partial | 2 |
| Rewriter only | 2 |
| Missing | 7 |

DSS's gap pattern mirrors IPSYN's. The two cleanest one-line
follow-ups: rewriter routing of `+cN` → `--max-utterances N` and
`+lF` → `--rules F` for the DSS subcommand specifically. Both
filed as Phase 1.7 follow-ups, batched with IPSYN's equivalents
and the existing MAXWD `+cN` → `--limit N` precedent.

## Scoring Categories

DSS scores utterances on eight grammatical categories:

1. **Indefinite pronouns / noun modifiers** (it, this, that)
2. **Personal pronouns** (I, me, my, mine, you, your)
3. **Main verbs** (uninflected, copula, auxiliary)
4. **Secondary verbs** (non-finite: infinitives, gerunds, participles)
5. **Negation** (no, not, can't, don't)
6. **Conjunctions** (and, but, or, if, because)
7. **Interrogative reversals** (is he, can you, do they)
8. **Wh-questions** (who, what, where, when, why, how)

Each category earns 1-8 points based on developmental complexity. A **sentence point** is awarded if the utterance is a complete grammatical sentence.

## Algorithm

1. Parse each utterance's `%mor` tier for POS-tagged morphemes
2. Match morpheme patterns against category rules
3. For each category, award points for the highest-scoring matched pattern
4. Award sentence point for complete sentences (heuristic: subject + verb POS)
5. Sum across categories + sentence point = utterance score
6. DSS = mean score across scored utterances

## Output

Per-speaker DSS total with per-category breakdown and per-utterance scores.

## Differences from CLAN

### Built-in rules

The default rules are a simplified subset of the canonical DSS rule set (10 categories). For full clinical scoring, supply a complete `.scr` rules file via `--rules`. When a rules file is not provided, DSS produces approximate scores suitable for screening but not clinical reporting.

### Sentence-point assignment

Uses a heuristic (presence of subject + verb POS tags in `%mor`) rather than full syntactic analysis. This may under-award sentence points for syntactically complex but structurally unusual utterances.

### Maximum utterances

Defaults to 50 per speaker (configurable via `--max-utterances`). CLAN also defaults to 50 but the implementation differs in how utterances are selected when the sample exceeds the maximum.

### Output formats

Supports text, JSON, and CSV. CLAN produces text only.

### Golden test parity

Verified against CLAN C binary output.
