# LIPP2CHAT -- LIPP Phonetic Profile to CHAT Conversion

## Purpose

Converts LIPP (Logical International Phonetics Programs) phonetic profile data into CHAT format. Each entry becomes an utterance, and phonetic transcriptions are placed on `%pho` dependent tiers.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan lipp2chat input.lipp
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `speaker` | `"SPK"` | Speaker code for all utterances |
| `language` | `"eng"` | ISO 639 language code for the `@Languages` header |
| `corpus` | `"lipp_corpus"` | Corpus name for the `@ID` header |

## Input Format

Tab-separated word and phonetic transcription, one pair per line:

```text
cat    kaet
dog    dog
```

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments. Single words without a tab-separated phonetic field are imported without a `%pho` tier.

## Output

A well-formed CHAT file where each LIPP entry becomes an utterance on the main tier. When a phonetic transcription is present, it is placed on a `%pho` dependent tier attached to the utterance.

## Differences from CLAN

- Uses typed AST for CHAT generation
- Produces valid, well-formed CHAT output
