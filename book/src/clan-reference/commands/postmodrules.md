# POSTMODRULES -- Modify POST Database Rules (deliberately not implemented)

**Status:** Reference -- stub command
**Last updated:** 2026-05-21 15:30 EDT

## Purpose

In legacy CLAN, `postmodrules` edits the POST disambiguation rule
database -- it allows researchers to update the context-sensitive
rules that [`post`](post.md) applies, without retraining the full
model.

This project does **not** implement `postmodrules`. The POST rule
database does not exist here -- the neural morphotag pipeline
([see `mor`](mor.md)) supersedes it.

## What to use instead

There is no direct replacement. Custom morphology rules are not part
of the batchalign pipeline; the Stanza models are trained
end-to-end. For per-language overrides batchalign provides
hand-curated rule modules (`crates/talkbank-transform/src/morphosyntax/lang_*.rs`)
-- see the [non-English language workarounds](../../batchalign/developer/non-english-workarounds.md)
chapter for the contributor entry point.

## Behavior

Invoking `chatter clan postmodrules` prints an error and exits
non-zero.
