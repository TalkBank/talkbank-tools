# POSTTRAIN -- Train POST Model (deliberately not implemented)

**Status:** Reference -- stub command
**Last updated:** 2026-05-21 15:30 EDT

## Purpose

In legacy CLAN, `posttrain` trains the POST disambiguation model
from a hand-annotated training corpus. It is the offline counterpart
to the runtime [`post`](post.md) disambiguator.

This project does **not** implement `posttrain`. The MOR/POST training
pipeline is replaced by Stanza's neural-model training infrastructure,
which lives upstream of batchalign and is not part of this toolchain.

## What to use instead

To train new morphological models, use Stanza's training pipeline
directly (see the [Stanza documentation](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/)),
then route the resulting models through batchalign's morphotag
pipeline.

## Behavior

Invoking `chatter clan posttrain` prints an error and exits non-zero.
