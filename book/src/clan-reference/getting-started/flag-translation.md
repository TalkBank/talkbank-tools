# Flag Translation Guide

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-05-11 18:58 EDT

The original CLAN uses a `+flag`/`-flag` syntax that differs from standard CLI conventions. The Rust reimplementation accepts both styles — legacy CLAN flags are automatically rewritten to modern `--flag` equivalents before parsing.

## Complete Flag Mapping

| CLAN Flag | Modern Equivalent | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| `+t*CHI` | `--speaker CHI` | Include speaker |
| `-t*CHI` | `--exclude-speaker CHI` | Exclude speaker |
| `+t%mor` | `--tier mor` | Include dependent tier |
| `-t%gra` | `--exclude-tier gra` | Exclude dependent tier |
| `+t@ID="..."` | `--id-filter "..."` | Filter by `@ID` header pattern |
| `+s<word>` | `--include-word <word>` | Include word |
| `-s<word>` | `--exclude-word <word>` | Exclude word |
| `+g<label>` | `--gem <label>` | Include gem segment |
| `-g<label>` | `--exclude-gem <label>` | Exclude gem segment |
| `+z25-125` | `--range 25-125` | Utterance range |
| `+r6` | `--include-retracings` | Count retraced material |
| `+u` | *(default behavior)* | Merge speakers (already default) |
| ~~`+dN`~~ | ~~`--display-mode N`~~ | Numeric display mode — **currently non-functional**: the rewriter at `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs:101` produces `--display-mode`, but no `clap` field consumes it. Tracked in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-11-clan-rewriter-honor-three-flags.md` Phase 3 (pending PI review). |
| ~~`+k`~~ | ~~`--case-sensitive`~~ | Case-sensitive matching — **currently non-functional**: the rewriter at `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs:104` produces `--case-sensitive`, but no `clap` field consumes it. Word matching is case-insensitive today. |
| ~~`+fEXT`~~ | ~~`--output-ext EXT`~~ | Output file extension — **currently non-functional**: the rewriter at `crates/talkbank-clan/src/clan_args.rs:107` produces `--output-ext`, but no `clap` field consumes it. Tracked as Phase 2 of the rewriter-honor plan (blocked on a batch-output prerequisite). |
| `+wN` | `--context-after N` | Context lines after match |
| `-wN` | `--context-before N` | Context lines before match |

## Examples

### Speaker Filtering

```bash
# Original CLAN: include CHI, exclude MOT
freq +t*CHI -t*MOT file.cha

# Modern equivalent
chatter clan freq --speaker CHI --exclude-speaker MOT file.cha
```

### Word Search

```bash
# Original CLAN: search for "want" and "need"
combo +s"want" +s"need" file.cha

# Modern equivalent
chatter clan combo --include-word want --include-word need file.cha
```

### Combined Filters

```bash
# Original CLAN: CHI speaker, utterances 10-50, include retraced material
freq +t*CHI +z10-50 +r6 file.cha

# Modern equivalent
chatter clan freq --speaker CHI --range 10-50 --include-retracings file.cha
```

## Notes

- The `+u` flag (merge speakers into a single analysis) is the default behavior and is accepted but ignored.
- Flags are position-independent — they can appear before or after file arguments.
- Unknown flags that don't match CLAN patterns pass through unchanged to clap, which will report an error with suggestions.
- The strikethrough entries above (`+dN`, `+k`, `+fEXT`) are rewritten by the legacy-flag layer but currently rejected by `clap` because no consuming field exists yet. See [`migrating-from-clan.md`](../../chatter/user-guide/migrating-from-clan.md) for the same caveats and the rewriter-honor plan that tracks them.
