//! The shared control plane for every worker-protocol V2 executor: one failure
//! taxonomy, and one operation that turns a Python request into a serialized

//!
//! **See also:** [INTERFACE_MAP.md](../../../INTERFACE_MAP.md) for the per-task
//! Python callers; this module owns only what all of them share.
//!
//! The ASR, FA and media executors each used to carry a private copy of this
//! control plane. The duplicated primitives moved here, and they are PRIVATE:
//! a public primitive is an invitation to re-implement the verb. Callers reach
