//! Pipeline decision provenance: tracking machine decisions for user review.
//!
//! Every batchalign3 command makes decisions that alter output: clamping
//! timestamps, stripping timing, skipping utterances, defaulting values,
//! normalizing text. These decisions are currently logged via `tracing` but
//! invisible to the user in the output CHAT file.
//!
//! This module defines `DecisionRecord`, a structured representation of a
//! machine decision retained in structured run evidence so users and tools
//! can review what the pipeline did and why without cluttering CHAT output.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Each pipeline stage (FA, UTR, morphosyntax, utseg, etc.) collects
//! `Vec<DecisionRecord>` during processing. The command orchestrator retains
//! those records in durable evidence and strips legacy `%xalign` / `%xrev`
//! tiers before serialization. `ReviewLevel` remains on the compatibility
//! wire surface for now, but no value authorizes CHAT-tier generation.

// Typed decision strategies
//
// Every strategy the pipeline can emit is declared as a variant of one of
// the per-module enums below, then wrapped in [`DecisionStrategy`] at the
// boundary with [`DecisionRecord`]. This replaces the previous stringly
// typed `strategy: &'static str` field so that:
//
// - Typos at construction sites fail to compile instead of producing a
//   novel strategy label consumers silently can't match.
// - Consumers can match exhaustively on the strategy set per module.
// - Adding a new strategy requires declaring its name in exactly one
//   place, and serialization + tracing derive from that declaration.
//
// The `as_str()` name on each per-module enum is the *label* that was
// previously typed as a string literal. Migration rule: if downstream
// consumers read `record.strategy == "end_clamped"`, their new read is
// `matches!(record.strategy, DecisionStrategy::Monotonicity(MonotonicityStrategy::EndClampedCoverageOnly
// | MonotonicityStrategy::EndClampedBoundaryFromWords | MonotonicityStrategy::EndClampedInterleavedWords))`.
