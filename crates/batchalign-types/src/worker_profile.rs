//! Worker profile domain type.

//! A [`WorkerProfile`] groups related [`crate::worker::InferTask`]s into fewer
//! Python worker processes so loaded models can be shared within a single process.
//!
//! This module holds the profile enum and the methods that depend only on types
//! already in `batchalign-types`.  Methods that depend on `batchalign`-internal
//! infrastructure (runtime free-threaded flag, command catalog) live as free
//! functions in `batchalign::worker::target`.  They will be folded back here as
//! a method in Phase β Task 2, once `MemoryTier` also lives in this crate.
