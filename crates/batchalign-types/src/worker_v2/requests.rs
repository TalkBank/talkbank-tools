//! Worker protocol V2 schema types shared across batchalign crates.
//!
//! These types define the next worker boundary described in
//! `book/src/developer/worker-protocol-v2.md`. Unlike the current
//! JSON-lines protocol in [`super::worker`], this schema is intentionally
//! staged for migration:
//!
//! - the types are drift-tested against Python
//! - canonical fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/worker_protocol_v2/`
//! - production code now dispatches FA, ASR, and speaker requests through
//!   these typed envelopes, while the remaining tasks are still staged
//!
//! The design goal is to keep Python as a thin model host while Rust owns
//! preprocessing, postprocessing, document semantics, and cache policy.
//!
//! ## Timing field validation contract
//!
//! Several response structs carry floating-point or integer timing fields
//! (`start_s`, `end_s`, `time_s`, `start_ms`, `end_ms`).  On the Python side,
//! Pydantic V2 models in `_types_v2.py` enforce upstream validation:
//! non-finite values (NaN, ±Inf) are rejected, and reversed ranges
//! (`start > end`) are rejected via `@model_validator`.  Rust deserializes
//! these fields permissively — `serde_json` will accept any valid JSON number
//! — because the Python worker has already sanitised the data before it
//! reaches the wire.  If a new producer is added that bypasses Python
//! validation, Rust-side checks must be added to the affected structs.
