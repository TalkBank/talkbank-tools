//! Coordinate spaces, containment proofs and explicit clamping for forced
//! alignment timings.
//!
//! # The defect this module exists to make unrepresentable
//!
//! A forced aligner is handed a WINDOW of audio and reports word timings
//! measured from the start of that window. Those times are then offset back
//! into whole-file coordinates before they are written into a transcript. Until
//! this module existed both coordinate spaces were `u64`, so
//!
//! ```ignore
//! timing.start_ms + audio_offset_ms
//! ```
//!
//! type-checked whether the offset was the right one, the wrong one, or omitted
//! entirely, and the sum was written out with no further question asked. The
//! only validation on the result was that its end exceeded its start, which is a
//! relation among the transcript's own numbers and says nothing about the
//! recording.
//!
//! Nothing in the pipeline carried the recording's LENGTH, so no code was in a
//! position to notice that a word had been placed after the audio stopped. The
//! consequence, measured on real deliveries: alignment output reaching 28.2
//! seconds past the end of the file it was aligned against, on 6 of 226 screened
//! sessions, producing utterances that name a moment no recording contains.
//! Downstream every one of those reads as a measurement.
//!
//! # The shape of the cure
//!
//! Three separate facts get three separate types, and the transitions between
//! them are the only routes:
//!
//! * [`WindowMs`] is what an ENGINE reports. It cannot be written into a
//!   transcript, because a transcript's timings are not measured from a window.
//! * [`FileMs`] is a point measured from the start of the recording. The only
//!   way to obtain one from a [`WindowMs`] is [`FaWindow::to_file`], which is
//!   also the only place the containment question can be asked, so it cannot be
//!   forgotten.
//! * [`RecordedInstant`] is a `FileMs` that a specific [`Recording`] has agreed
//!   lies inside itself. Only [`Recording::locate`] produces one.
//!
//! # Why clamping is a type and not a `.min()` call
//!
//! `x.min(bound)` is correct arithmetic and invisible behaviour: a caller
//! cannot tell a value that FITTED from one that was silently cut down to fit,
//! and "we had to cut this down" is usually the signal that a transcript is
//! describing more speech than the recording holds. [`Clamped`] makes the
//! difference a variant, so a caller that wants to count, log or refuse the
//! clamped case has to acknowledge it exists.
//!
//! **Where this type is and is not applied, adjudicated 2026-08-15 rather than
//! inherited.** An earlier draft of this paragraph listed four files as though
//! every `.min()` in them were a pending conversion. Nine sites were then read
//! individually, and only one was this shape:
//!
//! * `grouping.rs::estimate_untimed_boundaries` computed an aligner window end
//!   and cut it to the audio with `.min(total_audio_ms)`. That IS the shape,
//!   and it now goes through [`Recording::clamp_bound`], which returns
//!   [`Clamped`] so the call site names both arms and counts the second. A
//!   window running past the end of the recording is a fact about our own gap
//!   arithmetic, and it was unobservable.
//! * `postprocess.rs` has two, and NEITHER is a defect. The fallback cap at the
//!   next onset already records what it did in the value's [`Origin`]
//!   (`ClampedTo { bound: NextOnset, .. }` wrapping the assumption), which is
//!   the whole point of the type; and the utterance-boundary pair feeds
//!   `clamped_to_bullet`, which is the named operation. Converting either would
//!   move information that is already carried.
//! * `grouping.rs::extend_into_trailing_gap` and `expand_for_fillers.rs` cap an
//!   INCREMENT (`(gap / 2).min(MAX_..)`), not a position cut down to a domain
//!   bound. Nothing upstream is wrong when that cap binds; it is the policy
//!   working. A `Clamped` here would report a non-event on most utterances.
//! * `rescue_narrow_bullets.rs` selects among three candidate ends rather than
//!   trimming one to fit. Being capped by the next utterance is the expected
//!   case, not a signal.
//!
//! The distinction that decides it: [`Clamped`] is for a value cut down to fit
//! a bound where being cut MEANS something went wrong upstream. A maximum on an
//! increment, and a choice among candidates, are ordinary policy and stay
//! arithmetic.
