//! Pre-FA utterance bullet expansion for edge fillers.
//!
//! When a filler (`&-you_know`, `&-um`) sits at the start or end of an
//! utterance, the UTR-assigned bullet may be too narrow, ASR engines
//! typically don't transcribe fillers, so UTR never "sees" them. The
//! filler's audio lives in the gap between utterances, outside the bullet.
//!
//! This pass expands utterance bullets into adjacent gaps so the FA engine
//! receives audio covering the full utterance including edge fillers.
//! Runs after UTR but before FA grouping.
