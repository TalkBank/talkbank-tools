/// `enforce_monotonicity` strips a main-tier bullet when it is non-monotonic
/// (backward relative to the previous utterance).  However, if the utterance
/// also carries a `%wor` tier with the same backward timestamps, the NEXT
/// re-run will enter the `has_reusable_wor_timing` fast path, call
/// `refresh_existing_alignment`, and reconstruct the backward bullet from
/// the stale `%wor` data, reintroducing the E362 violation.
///
/// This function removes the `%wor` tier from every utterance that
/// `enforce_monotonicity` stripped, breaking the re-run cycle:
///
/// ```text
/// bad %wor → fast path → backward bullet → enforce strips bullet
///          → strip_wor removes %wor → next run skips fast path
///          → full FA re-aligns → correct timing
/// ```
///
/// Call this immediately after `enforce_monotonicity` wherever the
/// `has_reusable_wor_timing` fast path is used:
/// - `run_fa_from_ast` fast-path return in `batchalign/src/fa/mod.rs`
///
/// `decisions` must be the slice returned by `enforce_monotonicity`.
/// Only decisions with `module == DecisionModule::Monotonicity` and
/// `strategy == "timing_stripped"` are processed; end-clamped utterances
/// keep their `%wor` because their timing is still monotonic.
