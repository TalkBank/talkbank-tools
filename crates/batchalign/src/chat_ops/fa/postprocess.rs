/// A word's extent while post-processing is still deciding it, WITH the record
/// of how it got there.
///
/// # Why this exists
///
/// This module used to work on bare `TimeSpan`, deliberately: an extent under
/// construction may not satisfy `end > start` yet, so `WordTiming`'s invariant
/// cannot hold mid-computation. But dropping the invariant also dropped the
/// PROVENANCE, and that was not deliberate. Every pass below adjusts timings,
/// and a `TimeSpan` cannot say whether a value is what an engine measured, the
/// utterance bullet standing in for it, or a fabricated 500 ms; so the
/// distinction was destroyed here and reconstructed nowhere.
///
/// It derefs to the span, so reads are unchanged. Only the sites that CREATE a
/// value have to say what they did, which is the point.
///
/// # Why this is NOT merged into [`WordTiming`], though the fields match
///
/// Three review rounds have proposed collapsing the two on the grounds that
/// they hold the same three fields. They are a PHASE PAIR, and the fields are
/// the same on purpose: what differs is the invariant, which is the whole
/// reason both exist. A `WordTiming` guarantees `end > start`; a
/// `PendingTiming` does not, because the passes below move a boundary BETWEEN
/// two words and compute the new positions arithmetically. Those computations
/// are guarded, but the guard is arithmetic rather than proof, and
/// [`PendingTiming::settle`] is the single checked transition out.
///
/// Merging them costs one of two things and neither is worth it. Making
/// `WordTiming` the intermediate drops its invariant, which is what protects
/// the cache and every `%wor` tier. Making the intermediate carry the invariant
/// makes every `remeasured` call site fallible, so a repair that transiently
/// inverts a span could not be expressed at all and each site would grow a
/// `Result` for a case that `settle` already reports once.
///
/// Stated here rather than left for a fourth round to rediscover.

    //    when it only recognised the first word.  Clamping FA word timings to a
    //    UTR hint would drop every word beyond the first.

    // 2. The utterance already has a `%wor` tier (i.e., this is a RE-alignment,
    //    not a first-time alignment).
    //    After `transcribe` + `utseg`, utterance bullets are ASR-derived (from
    //    UTR token matching) and are serialized as `Authoritative` (BulletSource
    //    is not persisted in CHAT text).  These bullets can be as narrow as the
    //    ASR-matched span for one word (e.g., 220ms for a 3-second sentence when
    //    Rev.AI only matched the first word).  FA, given a wider group audio
    //    window, correctly aligns all words, but clamping to the narrow bullet
    //    would drop all but the first, breaking the output.
    //    The `%wor` tier is only present after a previous FA run, which means the
    //    utterance bullet was established by FA from word timings and is wide
    //    enough to cover the speech.  That is the only case where clamping is safe.
    //
    // Self-healing: `update_utterance_bullet` overwrites UTR hints with the FA
