//! Post-FA bullet repair: fix timing violations without destroying accuracy.
//!
//! Replaces CLAN's FIXBULLETS with three principled strategies:
//!
//! 1. **Same-speaker gap filling**: snap small gaps (500-1000ms) between
//!    consecutive same-speaker utterances.
//! 2. **Boundary averaging**: for small overlaps (≤ threshold), classified
//!    from measured word hulls through the same `EndOverlapResolution` Pass
//!    2 of monotonicity uses (2026-09-01 review, item 7). A cross-speaker
//!    pair is left alone (ordinary conversational overlap) unless the
//!    policy says every adjacent pair clamps; a same-speaker pair whose
//!    hulls do not overlap splits the difference, but never past either
//!    side's own measured hull, so it can only eat inherited coverage,
//!    never a real word; a pair whose hulls DO overlap is a genuine
//!    conflict and is clamped, bullet and words together, through the same
//!    route Pass 2 uses.
//! 3. **Selective timing removal via LIS**: for large violations, find the
//!    longest increasing subsequence of start times and strip timing from
//!    utterances outside the LIS.
//!
//! Design principle: every bullet either points to the correct audio location
//! or doesn't exist. No lying bullets.
