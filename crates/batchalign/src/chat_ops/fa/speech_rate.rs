//! How fast speech would have to be for some words to fit some audio.
//!
//! # Why this is a type and not an `f64` beside a threshold
//!
//! "These words cannot fit this span" is a physical fact about human speech,
//! and it is the fact that decides whether a piece of audio can be aligned at
//! all. It was known in exactly one place: a private `classify_bullet` in
//! `rescue_narrow_bullets`, over a private `CATASTROPHIC_DENSITY_THRESHOLD_WPS`.
//!
//! The place that needed it most could not see it. `estimate_untimed_boundaries`
//! distributes utterances that carry no bullet across whatever audio is left,
//! in proportion to word count, and asks nothing about whether the result is
//! possible. On a real session it placed **175 words into 0.291 seconds**, a
//! rate of 601 words per second, and handed the resulting window to an aligner.
//! Wave2Vec correctly refused it ("targets length is too long for CTC"); the
//! pipeline read that as an engine limitation and retried on Whisper, which pads
//! its input to a fixed 30 second window, cannot refuse, and duly reported
//! tokens across the padding. That is how 28.2 seconds of speech got timings in
//! a recording that had already ended.
//!
//! The threshold is unchanged. What changes is that both callers now ask the
//! same question of the same type, and a rate is a rate rather than a bare
//! float that happens to be compared against the right constant.
