//! Every word timing this run threw away must reach the run's evidence
//! artifact as a standalone, self-describing record.
//!
//! The defect these tests pin: `WordClampOutcome::DroppedPastBound` carries
//! the measured extent it lost, and that extent reached only the in-memory
//! effect stream, nested inside one variant of one tagged union. A reviewer
//! asking "what measurements did this run discard?" had to walk
//! `timing_decisions`, match a single tag, and join each dropped word back to
//! its parent for the speaker, the utterance and the bound it exceeded. A
//! measurement that is that hard to recover is, in practice, lost, which is
//! the concrete form of "preserve information; losing it is the defect".
//!
//! These are ARTIFACT tests, at the real seam: the pipeline runs, the
//! evidence file is written to disk, and the assertions read the JSON back.
//! No type can stand in for them, because the thing under test is a wire
//! format leaving the process.
