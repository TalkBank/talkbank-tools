/// 2026-09-01 review, item 16: the real-data E362 regression. CHI 88 and
/// CHI 90 are consecutive in CHI's own speaker stream (and here also file
/// adjacent); CHI 90 has no later same-speaker utterance at all, so the
/// item-15 speaker-stream successor guard alone would see no successor and
/// wrongly permit `BoundaryFromWords` to move CHI 90's start up to its
/// hull start (2950). PAR 89, immediately after CHI 90 in FILE order, only
/// starts at 2900 -- before that would-be new start. Pass 1 already
/// enforced file-order start monotonicity across every speaker before Pass
/// 2 ran; Pass 2 must not be able to undo it. The guard must therefore
/// read the FILE-order successor (any speaker), not the speaker's own.
///
/// The final assertion (no bullet start precedes its file predecessor's
/// start) restates Pass 1's own rule against Pass 2's output. That is
/// legitimate here specifically because Pass 1 and Pass 2 are two steps of
/// ONE phase (`enforce_monotonicity_with_policy`) with a single documented
/// obligation -- Pass 2 must preserve what Pass 1 established -- not a
/// general invariant check bolted onto an unrelated function.
