//! The life of a word's timing, as a sequence of types.
//!
//! # The thesis
//!
//! Every time this pipeline learns something new about a number, or decides
//! something on the number's behalf, the number becomes a DIFFERENT VALUE OF A
//! DIFFERENT TYPE. Not a mutated integer, not an integer with a comment: a new
//! type, produced by a named transition, carrying the story of how it got
//! there.
//!
//! The alternative is what this module replaces. A word's end used to be
//! computed like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let end_ms = token_starts_ms
//!     .get(token_idx)
//!     .copied()
//!     .unwrap_or(start_ms + LAST_WORD_FALLBACK_MS)
//!     .max(start_ms + 1);
//! ```
//!
//! Three separate decisions are taken in that expression and none of them
//! leaves a trace. The `unwrap_or` invents 500 milliseconds when no successor
//! exists. The `.max` nudges a span that had no width. A `.min` elsewhere cuts
//! a value down to fit the recording. Downstream, all four possible histories,
//! measured, inherited from a neighbour, invented, nudged, are the same `u64`,
//! and a reader of the resulting CHAT file cannot tell them apart. Neither can
//! a program. That is how a corpus comes to be 37 percent interpolated with
//! nothing marking which 37 percent.
//!
//! # The vocabulary
//!
//! * [`WordSpan`] is a word's extent. It cannot be built from integers: both
//!   ends must be [`RecordedInstant`]s, which only a [`Recording`] issues, and
//!   which each carry an [`Origin`]. Provenance is therefore not something a
//!   caller remembers to attach; it is the only way to construct the value.
//! * Every way of obtaining an end is a NAMED CONSTRUCTOR
//!   ([`WordSpan::measured`], [`WordSpan::end_from_next_onset`],
//!   [`WordSpan::end_assumed`]), so choosing one is a decision written in the
//!   source rather than a fallback buried in an expression.
//! * Every span that cannot exist is a [`SpanFault`], not a nudge. A word that
//!   starts and ends at the same instant is not a word with a one millisecond
//!   duration; it is an engine that failed, and saying so is more useful than
//!   papering over it.
//!
//! # What a reader gains
//!
//! `WordSpan::end_assumed(start, LAST_WORD_FALLBACK_MS, &recording)` says, in
//! its own name, that the end of this word was invented and by how much. No
//! comment is required, no `if` has to be traced, and the type of the result
//! ([`Clamped`]) forces the caller to acknowledge that the invention may have
//! been cut down to fit. That is the whole point: the logic lives in the types,
//! where it can be read, rather than in control flow, where it must be
//! reconstructed.
