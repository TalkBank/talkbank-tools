//! Utterance Timing Recovery (UTR): inject ASR-derived timing into untimed CHAT utterances.
//!
//! When a CHAT file has a mix of timed and untimed utterances, UTR uses ASR
//! output to recover utterance-level bullets for the untimed ones. This is a
//! pre-pass before forced alignment — FA then operates on a fully-timed file.
//!
//! Algorithm:
//! 1. Flatten ALL utterance words (timed + untimed) into one reference sequence,
//!    each tagged with its source utterance index.
//! 2. Try a cheap O(n+m) fast path: if the full transcript words are a
//!    *uniquely embedded* exact monotonic subsequence of the ASR token stream,
//!    use that directly.
//! 3. If the exact subsequence is missing or ambiguous, fall back to a single
//!    global Hirschberg DP alignment of all words against all ASR tokens
//!    (`dp_align::align`).
//! 4. Collect per-utterance min/max matched ASR token indices from the chosen
//!    alignment.
//! 5. Set `utterance.main.content.bullet` from matched tokens' time span
//!    (untimed only). Already-timed utterances are left unchanged.
//!
//! This global monotonic alignment is the current correctness boundary for UTR:
//! it fixes 407-style hand-edited transcript failures where earlier utterances
//! consumed tokens that later utterances needed. It does not make UTR
//! non-monotonic, so dense overlap / text-audio reordering cases can still
//! remain unmatched.
