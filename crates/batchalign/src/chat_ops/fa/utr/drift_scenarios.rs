//! Drift-class regression scenarios for UTR.
//!
//! These unit tests exercise the public [`super::inject_utr_timing`] entry
//! point against procedurally synthesized CHAT + ASR inputs that deterministically
//! reproduce the "monotonic DP drift" condition seen on real MICASE / biling /
//! rhd / samtale files. They are RED on the current `GlobalUtr`-backed pipeline
//! for at least the long-file + dense-overlap cases and are expected to turn
//! GREEN once Phase 3 of the segment-aware UTR plan flips `select_strategy` to
//! dispatch to `SegmentAwareUtr` — the same `inject_utr_timing` call is the
//! seam, so the tests are forward-compatible.
//!
//! # Invariants checked by [`run_and_check`]
//!
//! For every utterance that UTR assigned a bullet:
//!
//! 1. `end_ms > start_ms` (no zero- or negative-duration bullets).
//! 2. Adjacent **non-overlap** utterance bullets are strictly monotone in
//!    `start_ms`. Overlap-continuation utterances — those carrying a `+<`
//!    [`Linker::LazyOverlapPrecedes`] OR a `⌊` CA bottom-overlap marker —
//!    legitimately share timing with a predecessor and are EXCLUDED from the
//!    monotonicity chain (they neither participate in the comparison nor
//!    advance the `prev_start` cursor). This mirrors the overlap-aware pattern
//!    in the regression-harness arm for `UtteranceBulletMonotonicityPreserved`
//!    shipped with Task 1.1.
//! 3. Each assigned bullet lands inside the utterance's **ground-truth audio
//!    window**, expanded by one 500 ms word-cadence slack. This is the
//!    invariant that actually catches DP drift — the DP can remain
//!    monotone-preserving while still matching utterance K's words to tokens
//!    belonging to utterance K-3, producing a "wrong audio region" bullet
//!    that monotonicity alone cannot detect. Ground-truth windows are
//!    recovered from the synthetic cadence used in [`build_scenario`].
//!
//! # Scenario taxonomy

//! See the segment-aware-UTR design notes (operator-local) Task 1.2.

///    end_ms)` range and a `UttRole`. Overlap-bearing pair conventions
///    (`CaBracket`, `LazyPrecedes`) produce two adjacent utts with
///    intersecting ranges. `InlineBackchannel` places short backchannel utts
///    nested inside a host's range.
/// 2. [`place_words_in_time`]: distribute each utt's words uniformly across
///    its range, producing a flat Vec of timed tokens tagged with an
///    insertion_order for stable sort / drop-mask seeding.
/// 3. [`interleave_asr`]: sort the tokens by `start_ms` to produce the
///    temporal-order ASR stream. Overlapping utts now have interleaved words
///    in the ASR stream by construction.
/// 4. [`apply_asr_drop`]: probabilistically drop tokens at `asr_missing_rate`.
/// 5. [`emit_chat_source`]: serialize the CHAT in DOCUMENT order (layouts'
///    order), with convention-appropriate markup.
///
/// Drift arises from the impedance mismatch between document-order CHAT and
