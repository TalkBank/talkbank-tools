//! Two-pass UTR strategy for `+<` overlap-aware timing recovery.
//!
//! When overlapping speech is transcribed as separate utterances with `+<`
//! linkers, the backchannel words end up at the wrong position in the global
//! DP reference sequence. Pass 1 excludes `+<` utterances so the main-speaker
//! words align correctly, then pass 2 recovers backchannel timing from the
//! previous utterance's audio window.
//!
//! ## FA grouping stability
//!
//! Two-pass UTR can change anchor points for `estimate_untimed_boundaries`,
//! which alters FA group boundaries. Fewer, wider groups cause worse FA
//! alignment and lower final coverage — observed on German and Welsh files.
//!
//! When [`GroupingContext`] is provided, the best-of-both comparison uses FA
//! group counts as the primary signal: if two-pass creates fewer groups than
//! global, it falls back to global UTR before FA runs. Timed utterance count
//! remains the tiebreaker when grouping context is unavailable or group counts
//! are equal.
