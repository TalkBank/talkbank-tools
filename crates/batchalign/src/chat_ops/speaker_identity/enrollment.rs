//! Enrollment spans: the caller's claim that a stretch of audio holds one
//! known voice, alone.
//!
//! Everything a caller says about enrollment arrives as text on a command
//! line, and this module is the only place that text becomes a value. Past
//! this boundary an enrollment is a proven thing: its label is legal, its
//! window is non-empty, no two enrollments share a label, and no two overlap
//! in time.
//!
//! # Why "no two overlap" is refused here rather than reported later
//!
//! Two enrolled spans that overlap describe audio the caller has claimed
//! belongs to two different single speakers, which cannot both be true. There
//! is no useful thing to do with such a request, and the vectors it would
//! produce would each be contaminated by the other voice while still looking
//! like ordinary embeddings. Refusing at construction means no later stage has
//! to carry the possibility.
