//! The artifact this command produces: verdicts, with their provenance.
//!
//! # Why the provenance is in band
//!
//! An artifact records how it was made, beside itself, at the moment it is
//! made. Every number in this file depends on a choice somebody made: which
//! spans were enrolled, which threshold was stated, which acoustic model
//! produced the vectors, and which decode of the media they were computed
//! from. A reader six months later has none of that unless the file carries
//! it, and a reader who cannot reproduce a number treats it as unreproducible
//! rather than re-deriving it.
//!
//! # What this file is NOT
//!
//! It is not a corrected transcript, and it is not accuracy. A similarity is
//! AGREEMENT between two stretches of audio under one model; the enrollment
//! span is a human's claim about who is speaking and carries its own error
//! rate. The document says so in a field a reader cannot miss, because a bare
//! number between zero and one invites being read as a probability that the
//! speaker is who we say.
