//! The one conversion from recording milliseconds to prepared-audio frames.
//!
//! # The coordinate space this module adds, and why it is a third one
//!
//! `crate::time` already separates [`FileMs`], a position measured from the
//! start of the recording, from `WindowMs`, what an alignment engine reports
//! relative to the window it was handed. Speaker identification introduces a
//! third space: a FRAME INDEX into the prepared mono PCM view the worker
//! holds. It is a different space for the same reason the other two are: the
//! numbers are not interchangeable, and nothing but the sample rate and the
//! length of that particular decode relates them.
//!
//! The rule is the one `chat_ops::fa::coordinates` states for time:
//! [`PreparedPcm::locate`] is the ONLY route from a [`MediaWindow`] to a
//! [`FrameSpan`], because it is the only place that holds both the sample rate
//! and the frame count, and therefore the only place the containment question
//! can be asked. [`FrameSpan`] has no constructor from bare integers, so a
//! span cannot be minted from two numbers somebody computed by hand.
//!
//! # What `locate` refuses, and why that is a verdict rather than an error
//!
//! A bullet naming audio the recording does not contain is a real, recurring
//! state: transcripts outlive the media they were made against, and the FA
//! module exists partly because timings 28.2 seconds past the end of a file
//! reached real deliveries. Here it is refused, and the refusal carries the
//! bullet and the recording length so the caller can report the utterance
//! UNSCORED with the numbers a reader needs, rather than embedding whatever
//! bytes happen to sit at the end of the buffer.
