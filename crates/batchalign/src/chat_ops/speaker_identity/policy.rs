//! Similarity, the threshold policy, and the per-utterance verdict.
//!
//! # Why there is no default threshold anywhere in this file
//!
//! A threshold is a decision about how much acoustic agreement counts as the
//! same person, and it depends on the recording, the microphone, how much
//! enrollment audio there is and what the caller intends to do with a wrong
//! answer. Nothing in this crate knows any of that. A `Default` here would be
//! an invisible wrong value: every run would produce confident verdicts under
//! a number nobody chose and no output could show that it had been chosen by
//! accident. So [`MatchThreshold`] has no `Default`, [`ThresholdPolicy`] has
//! no `Default`, the CLI flag is required, and the chosen value is written
//! into the evidence beside the verdicts it produced.
//!
//! # The two decisions the policy makes, stated once
//!
//! 1. **A score exactly at the threshold matches.** The comparison is `>=`.
//!    `--threshold 0.5` means "0.5 or better". Both spellings are defensible;
//!    this one is the documented rule and the tests pin it as POLICY.
//! 2. **A tie at the maximum never matches.** The question the command
//!    answers is WHICH enrolled voice this is, and equal evidence for two of
//!    them does not answer it. Resolving the tie lexically would be
//!    deterministic and would still be a fact the evidence does not support.
//!    [`SpeakerVerdict::Matches`] therefore holds ONE label and
//!    [`SpeakerVerdict::NoMatch`] holds however many tied, so "matched two
//!    speakers" has no shape to travel through.
