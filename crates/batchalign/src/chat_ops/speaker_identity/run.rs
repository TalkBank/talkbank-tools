//! The whole decision, as one function over an injected inference capability.
//!
//! # Why the model is a trait and not a call
//!
//! Everything interesting about this command is arithmetic and policy over
//! vectors: which spans to ask about, what to do when a span cannot be
//! measured, and how a set of similarities becomes a verdict. None of that
//! needs a model to test, and all of it is where a defect would be invisible.
//! So [`SpeakerEmbeddingInference`] is a capability the caller supplies, and
//! every decision below is provable with a fake that returns chosen vectors.
//!
//! This is dependency injection without an authorization escape hatch, in the
//! same shape the Rev evidence boundary uses: the trait method consumes an
//! [`EmbeddingRequest`], which only [`identify_speakers`] builds, so a fake can
//! prove the pipeline end to end while production still cannot ask the worker
//! for a span that never went through [`PreparedPcm::locate`].
