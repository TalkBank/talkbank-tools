//! The authoritative command model for released processing commands.
//!
//! One catalog, one lookup, one import surface. Everything the rest of the crate
//! needs to know about a released command is a field of the `CatalogEntry`
//! declared in `recipe_runner::catalog`, or a `const fn` derived from its
//! family; this module is how the rest of the crate reaches it.
//!
//! Until 2026-07-29 there were three layers here: this module, a
//! `commands::catalog` of one-line delegations, and a pair of compatibility view
//! types (`CommandDefinition` / `CommandWorkflowDescriptor`) rebuilt on every
//! read from a mixture of declared fields and `match` arms. All three collapsed
//! into the declaration itself, which is what `command_model`'s original doc
//! comment set out to do: "so the rest of the app stops choosing between
//! parallel command catalogs."
