//! Per-file inference progress reporting for a morphotag job.
//!
//! One reporter per job owns the accounting and the publishing cadence; each
//! per-file task holds a cheap [`BackendProgressPort`] that stamps its own
//! provenance onto every report. Nothing here is shared mutable state: the
//! ledger lives in the drain task and reaches it only over a channel.
//!
//! ```text
//! dispatch_morphotag_job
//!   ├── BatchProgressReporter::spawn(sink, job_id)      ── owns the ledger
//!   ├── per file: reporter.port(filename) ──▶ MorphosyntaxParams.progress
//!   │                                            └─▶ infer_batch ─▶ per chunk

//!
//! # History
//!
//! `15c88de2` (2026-04-28) had a working drain loop in the legacy batched-text
//! dispatch, and a 61-line `BatchProgressReporter` written to replace it that
//! nothing ever constructed. `e8235c13` (2026-05-03) deleted the working loop
//! and left the unused successor behind, so the feature died with a designed
//! replacement sitting dead on arrival: the "frozen mid-sentence" state the
//! rearchitecture charter describes. This is that successor, built for the
//! per-file-fanout architecture that replaced the pooled one, with the
//! aggregation defect fixed (see [`crate::runner::util::batch_progress`]).
