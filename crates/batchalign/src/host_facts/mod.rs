//! `HostFacts` — single source of truth for "what is this host?".
//!
//! The architectural goal: every piece of code that needs to know "does
//! this host have a GPU?", "how much RAM is available?", "what OS is
//! running?" reads from one struct populated once at server startup.
//! That struct is `HostFacts`. Pure functions downstream (`recommend()`,
//! `validate()`) consume it and produce derived knobs / configuration
//! warnings without re-querying the OS.
//!
//! This module is the **type scaffolding** for that architecture
//! (Phase A1 of the migration described in
//! `talkbank/docs/investigations/2026-04-25-host-facts-architecture.md`).
//! No production code consumes `HostFacts` yet; `Real::detect()` is a
//! `todo!()` placeholder. The point of landing the types first is that
//! every later phase's tests can be written against the `Mock` source
//! without waiting for live detection to be implemented.
//!
//! Layering:
//! - `os.rs` — `OperatingSystem`, `CpuArch`
//! - `gpu.rs` — `GpuPresence`, `MpsExclusionReason`
//! - `warnings.rs` — `DetectionWarning`
//! - `mod.rs` (this file) — `HostFacts`, `HostFactsSource` trait,
//!   `RealHostFactsSource` and `MockHostFactsSource` impls.
