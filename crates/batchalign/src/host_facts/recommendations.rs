//! `auto_tune::compute_job_workers`, `pool::effective_max_total_workers`,
//! and `resolve::resolved_memory_gate_mb` are codified. Each knob has

//!
//! Phase B1 adds `gpu_thread_pool_size` — the knob that motivated the
//! architecture (see
//! `talkbank/docs/postmortems/2026-04-25-whisper-hub-malayalam-queue-wait-timeout.md`).
