//! Shared `HostFacts` fixtures for tests across the host-facts pipeline.
//!
//! Test code in `recommendations`, `effective`, `validation`,
//! `mod.rs`, and the cross-crate doctor CLI all need synthesized
//! "Apple Silicon 64 GB" / "Linux CUDA 24 GB" host shapes to drive
//! their assertions. Centralizing the fixtures keeps every consumer
//! pointed at the same canonical fact set; if a future field is
//! added to `HostFacts`, one edit here updates every test.
//!
//! Always public so the cross-crate doctor tests in `batchalign-cli`
//! can `use crate::host_facts::test_helpers::*` without
//! wrestling with `#[cfg(test)]` visibility across the workspace.
//! The fixtures themselves are tiny pure-data builders — no state,
//! no I/O — so the public surface cost is essentially zero.
