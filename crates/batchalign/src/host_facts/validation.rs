//! Config-vs-host-facts validation.
//!
//! At server startup, after `EffectiveConfig::resolve_from_server_config`
//! has merged operator overrides with the host-facts recommendation,
//! [`validate`] inspects the *original* operator overrides against the
//! detected facts and reports two kinds of finding:
//!
//! - [`ConfigWarning`] — the override is suboptimal but the server can
//!   still run. Surfaced as `tracing::warn!` lines at startup so the
//!   operator notices, but never blocks. Conservative-vs-recommendation
//!   mismatches (operator over-conservative — fewer workers than the
//!   host could support) are intentionally **silent**: the operator
//!   knows their host better than `recommend()` does, and silence is
//!   the right ergonomics for "intentionally cautious."
//! - [`ConfigError`] — the override would deterministically crash or
//!   produce wrong output (e.g., per-job worker × concurrent jobs ×
//!   peak RAM exceeds physical RAM). Reserved for cases where running
//!   would clearly fail; the server refuses to start with a message
//!   that includes the recommendation.
//!
//! See `talkbank/docs/investigations/2026-04-25-host-facts-architecture.md`
//! § Layer 4 for the validate-warns-mostly rationale (decision Q2).
//!
//! ## Why not use `EffectiveConfig` directly
//!
//! Validation needs to know which knobs the operator *explicitly set*
//! versus which fell through to the recommendation, because the
//! "operator contradicts facts" warnings only fire on explicit
//! overrides. `EffectiveConfig` has already merged the two, so the
//! distinction is gone there. `validate` reads from `ServerConfig`
//! (where `Some(_)` means explicit, `None` means deferred to
//! recommendation) plus `HostFacts` directly.
