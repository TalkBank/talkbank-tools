/// What a transcript SAYS about its own recording.
///
/// A sum type rather than a bool, because the three cases are three different
/// things for an operator to DO. When resolution fails, the message previously
/// said "Cannot find audio file" for all three, which is only true of one:
///
/// * [`Expected`](Self::Expected): the transcript names a recording and means
///   it. Nothing found means a staging or media-mapping fault, and the roots
///   are what to look at.
/// * [`Absent`](Self::Absent): the transcript declares the recording gone. The
///   pipeline found nothing because there is nothing, which is a fact about the
///   corpus and not a fault of the run.
/// * [`Undeclared`](Self::Undeclared): no `@Media` header at all, so there was
///   never a declared name to look for and stem matching was the only route.
///
/// **Read only AFTER the search has failed, never before it**, and the reason
/// is not the one first written here. That said 2,618 transcripts "declare
/// their media `missing` or `unlinked` while a file of that name is on disk",
/// which conflated the two: `unlinked` never declared anything absent, and
/// measured over the same corpus, ZERO of the 3,018 transcripts declaring
/// `missing` have a recording on disk. Short-circuiting would cost nothing
/// today.
///
/// It stays after the search anyway, because a declaration is a hand-written
/// CLAIM about a file somewhere else, and the run has the actual filesystem in
/// front of it. Trusting the claim over the evidence would make a stale header
/// silently skip a file that can be aligned, and the ordering costs nothing:
/// this is reached only once the search has already failed.
