//! Reading properties of media without producing anything.
//!
//! The sibling of [`super::transcode`]: that one writes a file, this one
//! answers a question. Both exist for the same reason, which is that the
//! OPERATION is where the invariants live.
//!
//! Duration probing was the last production spawn outside these types, and it
//! escaped the earlier consolidation for a revealing reason: it is async, and
//! the spawn helper was blocking. So the split that kept it out was a LANGUAGE
//! boundary, not a domain one. Its cost was a total function that returned
//! `Option<u64>` and folded four different facts into `None`: ffprobe is not
//! installed, ffprobe was killed, ffprobe refused the file, and ffprobe printed
//! something unparseable. An operator seeing "no duration" could not tell a
//! missing dependency from a corrupt file.
