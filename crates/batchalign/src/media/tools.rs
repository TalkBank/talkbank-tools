//! The external media tools this crate shells out to.
//!
//! ONE statement of each tool's name, and one construction path for every
//! spawn of it. The names were previously written as string literals at every
//! call site across six modules, and `ffmpeg`'s availability predicate existed
//! four times: the real one in `ensure_wav`, a delegating shim in
//! `artifacts_v2`, and two independent copies in test code. `ffprobe` had no
//! predicate at all, so `doctor` open-coded its own spawn to ask the question.
//!
//! Nothing here proves a tool WORKS, and the distinction is load-bearing.
//! `ffmpeg` can be installed, on `PATH`, and answer `-version` correctly while
//! every actual decode fails: the decoding path pulls in separately-versioned
//! shared libraries, so a system upgrade can break decoding without touching
//! the binary this module spawns. A capability token minted from `available()`
//! would therefore read `true` on exactly the machines that cannot process
//! audio, which is a label wearing a proof's clothes. Presence is also a fact
//! about the world at the moment it is probed, and the world can change before
//! the spawn.
//!
//! So availability answers "can this be run", and nothing more. Proof that a
//! machine can actually decode is a separate, stronger check that reads real
//! audio and inspects the frames it gets back.
