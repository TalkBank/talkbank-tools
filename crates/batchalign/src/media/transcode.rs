//! Producing model-ready audio from arbitrary media.
//!
//! # Why this type exists
//!
//! Four call sites used to spell out the same ffmpeg invocation by hand:
//!
//! ```text
//! -y [-ss START -to END] -i SOURCE [-f f32le] -acodec pcm_{s16le,f32le} \
//!    -ar 16000 -ac 1 DESTINATION
//! ```
//!
//! differing only in whether a window was present and which PCM encoding came
//! out. Each then repeated the same three steps afterwards: check the exit
//! status, delete the partial output on failure, and build its own module's
//! "ffmpeg failed" error carrying stderr. And each classified a failure to
//! SPAWN separately from a failure to RUN.
//!
//! Naming the tool did not fix that, which is the lesson worth keeping. An
//! earlier pass gave `ffmpeg` one owner for its NAME, its spawn construction
//! and its availability predicate, and every one of those duplications
//! survived, because they do not live in the tool. They live in the OPERATION,
//! and the operation had no type. A well-typed noun with an untyped verb is a
//! defect factory: the verb is where the invariants are, so the verb is where
//! callers duplicate.
//!
//! # What this makes unrepresentable
//!
//! - An argv this crate does not support. There is no way to spell one.
//! - A window whose end does not follow its start. [`MediaWindow`] refuses it
//!   at construction, so the check cannot be forgotten by a new call site and
//!   cannot be reported (as it once was) as an I/O error.
//! - A partial output file surviving a failed transcode. The cleanup is inside
//!   [`Transcode::produce`], not restated by each caller.
//! - A spawn failure read as a transcode failure, or the reverse.
//!
//! # What it deliberately leaves to callers
//!
//! Whether a SUCCESSFUL transcode that produced zero bytes is an error.
//! `ffmpeg` exits 0 when a requested window falls entirely past the end of the
//! source, and the two consumers legitimately differ: one reports an
//! empty-segment error naming the window, the other has no window to name.
//! [`ProducedMedia`] therefore reports the byte length as a FACT and judges
//! nothing.
