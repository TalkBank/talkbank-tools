//! Rust-owned Rev.AI integration for the server control plane.
//!
//! This module is where batchalign-app keeps Rev.AI work that does not belong
//! in Python:
//! - loading credentials for server-owned operations
//! - direct server-owned Rev.AI ASR inference for transcribe, benchmark, and
//!   Rev-backed UTR during align
//!
//! In server mode, Rev.AI is no longer a Python worker concern. The worker
//! boundary remains reserved for engines that genuinely require Python runtime
//! or model libraries.
