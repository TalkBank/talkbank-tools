//! Inference progress for the batched-text commands.
//!
//! # What this exists to answer
//!
//! "How far into this file's inference are we." A file's utterances go to a text
//! backend as a batch, so without this the file carries a stage
//! (`FileStage::Analyzing`) and no numbers for the whole of its inference, which
//! was the largest remaining violation of the crate's time-transparency rule
//! (see `book/src/batchalign/architecture/time-transparency.md`): every audio
//! command publishes counts, and the batched-text path did not.
//!
//! The backend already produces the numbers.
//! `batchalign/worker/_text_v2.py` installs an `_on_progress` callback that
//! emits a `progress_v2` event at most once per second per request, carrying
//! `completed` / `total` utterances. This module is the accounting that turns
//! that stream into one honest per-file count.
//!
//! # One projection, per input file
//!
//! ```text
//! Python backend ──progress_v2──▶ worker handle ──▶ BackendProgress

//!                                        file-progress channel)
//! ```
//!
//! # Why there is no job-level per-language aggregate any more
//!
//! There was one (`BatchInferProgress`), with a REST field, a dashboard panel
//! and a CLI summary line, and it was **retired on 2026-07-30 because it could
//! not be made honest** under per-file processing.
//!
//! A denominator only enters this ledger when a file's payloads are collected
//! and dispatched, and files are dispatched `num_workers` at a time. So a
//! job-wide "1250/1500 utterances (83%)" was really "83% of the handful of
//! files currently in flight", displayed next to `0/740 files` and drifting up
//! toward truth over hours. Under the pooled batching this replaced, the same
//! field was honest: everything was pooled up front, so the denominator really
//! was the job. Making it honest again would mean parsing every file before
//! dispatch, which is exactly the up-front work that was deliberately removed
//! for interfering with per-file processing.
//!
//! A file's own total, by contrast, is exact the moment its payloads exist. If
//! a job-level view is ever wanted, the honest form is a rate or ETA computed
//! from COMPLETED files, not a mid-flight utterance percentage.
//!
//! # Why the key is (source, group, chunk)
//!
//! This is the correction that makes the feature trustworthy, and it is worth
//! reading before changing anything here.
//!
//! `morphosyntax::worker::infer_batch_homogeneous` splits one language group
//! into up to `max_workers_per_key` chunks whenever it holds `2 *
//! MIN_CHUNK_SIZE` items or more, which on any multi-worker host is always.
//! Each chunk is a separate backend request reporting its OWN `completed` /
//! `total`. The 2026-04 ledger keyed on language alone, took the first
//! event's `total` as the denominator, and let each later event overwrite
//! `completed`. With four chunks of 274 items that displayed `453/274`, i.e.
//! 165%, which is exactly the overflow recorded in this module's history and
//! observed live before the feature was removed on 2026-05-03.
//!
//! Keying on the CHUNK rather than the request id is deliberate:
//! `dispatch_execute_v2_with_retry_and_progress` retries a chunk under a
//! fresh request id, so a request-keyed ledger would count a retried chunk's
//! utterances twice and keep the abandoned attempt's stale count forever. The
//! chunk is the stable unit of work; the request is one attempt at it.
//!
//! Completions are therefore SUMMED across chunks and the latest report per
//! chunk wins, which is correct under both chunking and retry. The DENOMINATOR
//! is not summed from chunk reports at all: it is declared up front (see
//! [`ProgressReport::GroupTotal`]), because a file whose first chunk finished
//! would otherwise look complete while its other chunks had not started, and the
//! publisher would skip it as done. That bug shipped briefly on 2026-07-30 and
//! is pinned by `one_finished_chunk_does_not_make_a_file_look_complete`.
