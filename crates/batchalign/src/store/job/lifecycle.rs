//! Job-level lifecycle transitions.
//!
//! These methods move the job through its top-level state machine.
//! From an active state (`Queued | Running`), a job reaches one of three
//! terminal endpoints — or, on graceful shutdown, the recovery-eligible
//! `Interrupted` state:
//!
//! ```text
//! Queued → Running → { Completed | Failed | Cancelled | Interrupted }
//! ```
//!
//! `Cancelled` is reserved for user gestures (TUI cancel, HTTP DELETE/cancel)
//! and is permanent. `Interrupted` is the system-initiated counterpart written
//! by `interrupt_for_shutdown`: although `JobStatus::is_terminal()` returns
//! `true` for it, the recovery sequence at startup is special-cased to
//! transition resumable Interrupted rows back to `Queued` (see
//! `reconcile_recovered_runtime_state` here and `load_from_db` in
//! `store/queries/recovery.rs`).
//!
//! Restart preparation (`prepare_for_restart`) resets unfinished file work
//! while preserving completed results, enabling partial retry after failures.
