//! The port a server is ASKED to listen on.
//!
//! This exists to keep a request apart from an observation. `PortRequest` is
//! what an operator wrote in `server.yaml`; the port the server ends up
//! listening on is [`BoundPort`](crate::server_handshake::BoundPort), and the
//! only way to obtain one is from a listener that has already bound.
//!
//! Before this type, both were `u16`, so any `format!("http://127.0.0.1:{}",
//! cfg.port)` silently claimed the request had been granted. That assumption
//! holds for a fixed port and fails for an ephemeral one, and nothing in the
//! type said which case a given `u16` was.
//!
//! It also reclaims `0`. TCP spends `0` on "let the OS choose a free port",
//! which is the standing way to ask for an ephemeral bind; `ServerConfig::validate`
//! used to rewrite it to 8000 with a warning, so the one value that could
//! express the request was the one value that could not survive being written
//! down.
