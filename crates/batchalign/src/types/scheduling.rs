//! Scheduling, retry, and work-unit domain types.
//!
//! These types describe the control-plane concepts that sit above individual
//! worker IPC messages:
//!
//! - what kind of unit is being scheduled
//! - how failures are classified
//! - whether a failure is retryable, deferrable, or terminal
//! - what retry policy should apply
//! - what happened on a concrete attempt
//!
//! The goal is to keep these concepts explicit and shared before fleet mode is
//! reintroduced, so the single-node server and future multi-node control plane
//! speak the same language.
