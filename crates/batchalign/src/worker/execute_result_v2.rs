//! One reader for worker-protocol V2 execute responses.
//!
//! [`ExecuteResponseV2`] used to split a single fact across two public fields
//! (an outcome beside an `Option<TaskResultV2>`), so every result adapter
//! checked both by hand, in an order nobody wrote down. Four adapters checked
//! the outcome first and two checked the payload first; since a failed request
//! carries no payload, the two that led with the payload reported every typed
//! error response as "missing a result payload" and threw away the protocol
//! code and message the worker had actually sent.
//!
//! The pairing is structural since 2026-08-21 (the type's interior is a
//! validated enum, and deserialization refuses a disagreeing wire value), so
//! `ExecuteResponseV2::read` is total over the two legal shapes. This module
//! keeps only the shared message shape every adapter uses.
