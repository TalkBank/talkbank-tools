/// When this guard is dropped (whether the dispatch succeeded or failed),

/// is released, unblocking the next caller waiting in `checkout()`.
///
/// If the worker was *taken* via [`take()`](Self::take) (e.g. because it

/// instead and no permit is released -- the worker slot is permanently
/// freed so a fresh worker can be spawned later.
