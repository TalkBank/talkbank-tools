//! Live CPU-loadavg admission gate.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! For four months admission has been governed by static estimates —
//! tier-derived `max_concurrent_jobs`, recommender-output
//! `max_workers_per_key`, empirical caps on the recommender output —
//! and every estimate has turned out wrong on at least one
//! command/host combination. Today's measurement (2026-05-08) on ming
//! puts morphotag's contention knee at K=4 and align's at K=1: a
//! single static value cannot satisfy both.
//!
//! The 1-minute CPU load average answers the question the static
//! estimates were trying to approximate ("does this host have CPU
//! headroom for one more worker?") with a runtime measurement instead.
//! `getloadavg(3)` is exposed identically on Linux and macOS (verified
//! responsive on Apple Silicon, 2026-05-08); `sysinfo::System::load_average()`
//! wraps it. The gate refuses spawns when the 1-minute load is
//! already at or above the host's CPU count — the universal
//! "system is fully busy" boundary, no per-host tuning required.
//!
//! # Where this plugs in
//!
//! Called from
//! [`crate::worker::pool::WorkerPool::try_claim_spawn_slot`] before
//! the global-permit acquisition so a CPU-saturation refusal does
//! not consume (and immediately refund) a global-cap permit. This is
//! the first measurement-based admission predicate; future predicates
//! (per-job RSS observation, available-memory delta tracking) will
//! plug in alongside it.
