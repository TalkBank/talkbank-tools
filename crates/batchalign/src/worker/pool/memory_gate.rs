//! Live available-memory admission gate.
//!
//! # The architectural principle
//!
//! Admission gates are **back-pressure, not safety**. Safety against
//! actual at-spawn OOM is one layer down: `memory_guard` (per-worker
//! RSS observation + kill) and the OS OOM killer. The admission gate
//! exists to slow down N+1 spawns when existing workers are
//! pressured — not to refuse the FIRST spawn on an empty pool, which
//! has no contention to back-pressure against.
//!
//! Earlier versions of this module conflated the two: a single rule
//! `available - reservation > floor` decided both cases, and on
//! memory-tight hosts (laptops, CI runners) it refused the cold-start
//! spawn, leaving the pool dead-on-arrival with no path to recover
//! (eviction has nothing to evict). That violated the rearch's stated
//! goal of "accurate, dynamic capability checking that doesn't block
//! weaker machines from doing work." See [`PoolGateState`] for the
//! cold-start vs warm distinction the gate now honors.
//!
//! # The two layers
//!
//! 1. **Cold-start bypass** — `PoolGateState::ColdStart` admits
//!    unconditionally. No back-pressure has anything to push
//!    against on an empty pool; the right place to surface
//!    host-too-small failures is `memory_guard` after spawn.
//! 2. **Warm-pool projection** — `PoolGateState::Warm` runs the
//!    `available - reservation > floor` check. Refusing here
//!    relieves real contention rather than wedging the pool.
//!
//! # The floor
//!
//! Tier-scaled, not fixed. See
//! [`host_min_free_mb_threshold_for_tier`]. The previous fixed
//! 2048 MB was right for Medium-tier workstations and wrong on every
//! other tier — too tight on laptops (50% of a 4 GB machine), too
//! loose on fleet (0.78% of a 256 GB machine).
//!
//! No env var, no `PoolConfig` field, no operator override. The
//! daemon is deployed by `pyinfra` from a Claude-generated
//! `server.yaml` that no human reads or edits.
//!
//! # Where this plugs in
//!
//! Called from
//! [`crate::worker::pool::WorkerPool::try_claim_spawn_slot`] as
//! Layer 0.5 — after the [`super::cpu_gate`] check, before the
//! global-permit acquisition. Memory and CPU rejections do not
//! consume permits; they refuse the spawn outright and let the
//! caller retry once the host frees up.

    // FIRST worker on memory-constrained hosts because the
    // empty-pool case went through the same projection as the
    // populated-pool case. That left the pool dead-on-arrival on
    // hosts where `available - reservation < floor`, with no path to
    // ever spawn a worker (eviction has nothing to evict).
    //
    // The principled architecture: admission gates are
    // back-pressure, not safety. Safety lives in memory_guard
    // (per-worker RSS observation + kill) and the OS OOM killer.
    // The admission gate's job is to slow down N+1 spawns when
    // existing workers are pressured — not to refuse the FIRST
    // spawn on an empty pool, which has no contention to
    // back-pressure against.
    //
    // Plus the floor: 2048 MB is wrong on both extremes. On a 4 GB
    // host it's 50% of total RAM (silly). On a 256 GB fleet host
    // it's 0.78% (silly). The floor needs to scale with tier just
    // like the per-profile reservation does.
