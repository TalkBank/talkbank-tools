//! `WorkerPool`: manages multiple Python worker processes.
//!
//! Workers are keyed by bootstrap target, language, and typed engine selection.
//! Large hosts may use shared profile targets such as `profile:gpu`, while
//! constrained hosts use task targets such as `infer:asr` so one laptop does
//! not hold unrelated models in memory.
//!
//! Each key maps to a `WorkerGroup` containing up to `max_workers_per_key`
//! workers, spawned lazily on demand. Background tasks handle health checking
//! and idle timeouts.
//!
//! ## Concurrency model
//!
//! Workers are *owned values* in a `VecDeque`, not wrapped in `Arc<Mutex>`.
//! Availability is tracked by a `tokio::sync::Semaphore` (one permit per idle
//! worker). Callers *check out* a worker via `checkout()`, which acquires a
//! semaphore permit (async wait if all busy) then pops from the idle queue.
//! The returned `CheckedOutWorker` is an RAII guard that returns the worker
//! to the pool on drop.
//!
//! This eliminates the previous `Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<WorkerHandle>>` pattern
//! where a tokio mutex was held for 10-300 seconds during dispatch.
//!
//! ## Module layout
//!
//! | File | Responsibility |
