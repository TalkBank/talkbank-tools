//! Worker pre-scaling.
//!
//! `pre_scale()` eagerly spawns workers for a specific command/lang before file
//! dispatch begins, so a batch does not pay one cold start per concurrent file.
//!
//! There used to be a sibling `warmup()` here that pre-spawned workers for a
//! configured command list at server startup. It was disabled on every real
//! server from 2026-03-26 onward (`HostExecutionPolicy::allows_command_warmup`
//! required test-echo mode), following the 2026-03-11 finding that warmed
//! models persist in memory for the server's whole lifetime, and was retired
//! in full on 2026-07-30. Pre-scale plus pressure-driven idle eviction is what
//! serves that need now: both act on demonstrated demand rather than on a
//! guess made at startup.
