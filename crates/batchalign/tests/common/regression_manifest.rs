//! Typed manifest for the per-command regression-fixture system.
//!
//! Each regression fixture in `test-fixtures/<command>/regressions/<bug-name>/`
//! ships a `source.json` file describing where the fixture came from, what bug
//! it captures, and how the runner should validate the output. This module
//! parses that JSON into typed Rust structs and exposes the assertion checks
//! the runner applies.
//!
//! See `test-fixtures/README.md` for the full directory layout and the JSON
//! schema. See `tests/ml_golden/regression_fixtures.rs` for the runner that
//! consumes these manifests.
