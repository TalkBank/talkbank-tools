//! Per-test-binary, ConfigKey-keyed Python-worker fixture.
//!
//! Each `cargo test` run of the worker-spawning suites fork/exec's
//! ~50 `uv run python -m batchalign.worker` processes. At default parallelism
//! the spawn tail under contention exceeded `ready_timeout_s`, producing
//! flaky failures. `.config/nextest.toml` currently caps the group at
//! `max-threads = 4` to make spawn cost an OS-bounded constant rather than
//! a tail distribution. This fixture is the principled fix that makes the
//! cap unnecessary: tests within a binary share workers keyed by the subset
//! of [`WorkerConfig`] the Python child observes at startup.
//!
//! Fields the Python child does NOT observe, `ready_timeout_s`,
//! `audio_task_timeout_s`, `analysis_task_timeout_s`, `runtime.host_memory`,
//! `runtime.memory_tier`, `runtime.server_instance_id`,
//! `runtime.server_process_id`: are deliberately excluded from
//! [`ConfigKey`], so tests that vary only those fields still share a worker.
//! Source of truth for the observed/excluded split is
//! `crate::worker::handle::spawn::build_worker_command`; if a flag or env
//! var is added there, mirror it in [`ConfigKey`].
//!
//! Workers live for the test-binary process lifetime; the `OnceLock` is
//! never dropped, so on process exit the workers become orphans and are
//! reaped on the next batchalign run via the worker registry's PID-file
//! mechanism. Acceptable for `--test-echo` workers (no model state).
//!
//! # Why the workers get their own runtime
//!
//! A pooled worker outlives the test that happened to spawn it, but
//! `#[tokio::test]` gives every test its OWN runtime and drops it at the end
//! of that test. A `WorkerHandle` owns a `tokio::process::Child` whose I/O is
//! registered with the reactor of the runtime that created it, so spawning
//! under a per-test runtime left every later test holding a handle whose
//! reactor was gone:
//!
//! ```text
//! A Tokio 1.x context was found, but it is being shutdown.
//! ```
//!
//! That failed 5 to 6 of `worker_integration`'s tests depending on which test
//! initialised the pool first, so it looked order-dependent and intermittent
//! rather than structural (found 2026-07-29, after two unrelated failures
//! stopped masking this binary).
//!
//! Workers are therefore spawned ON [`worker_runtime()`], a static
//! multi-thread runtime that is never dropped. Its reactor outlives every
//! test, so a handle stays usable no matter which test's runtime later awaits
//! it.
