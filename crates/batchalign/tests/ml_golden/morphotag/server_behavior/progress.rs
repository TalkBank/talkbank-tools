/// Verify an operator can see a long morphotag file ADVANCING, not just
/// "Analyzing" with no numbers.
///
/// **Rewritten 2026-07-29, and the reason matters.** This test used to assert
/// that a `--batch-window` job reported progress on `FileProgressStage::Parsing`.
/// Two things it depended on do not exist:
///
/// 1. `FileProgressStage::Parsing` has NO producer anywhere in the crate. It is
///    declared in the API enum and referenced only by the TUI's colour map, so
///    the assertion could never have passed.
/// 2. `batch_window` is parsed from `--batch-window`, stored in options and
///    serialized, and then read by NOTHING in the execution path. The windowing
///    it names is not part of the per-file-fanout architecture that replaced the
///    pooled one. That is an operator-visible flag doing nothing, recorded for
///    adjudication rather than quietly deleted here.
///
/// What now exists, and what this asserts: per-file utterance counts published
/// from the batch-progress ledger's per-source projection, on the ordinary
/// file-progress channel every other command uses. That is the signal an
/// operator watching one long file actually needs.
