//! Per-key worker count throughput sweep for the Stanza profile.
//!
//! [`recommend_max_workers_per_key`] derives per-profile worker counts
//! from RAM only:
//!
//! ```text
//! gpu    = clamp(ram / 16 GB, 1, 8)
//! stanza = clamp(ram / 12 GB, 1, 8)
//! io     = 1
//! ```
//!
//! Hosts with abundant RAM but limited core count can find the
//! RAM-only formula recommends more Stanza workers than their cores
//! actually support — every Stanza worker is a CPU-bound process, so
//! oversubscribing cores costs throughput rather than buying it. This
//! test exercises that question empirically: sweep
//! `max_workers_per_key.stanza` while holding everything else fixed,
//! dispatch a fixed number of concurrent batched-infer requests, and
//! record the wall-clock to all-complete. The output line per
//! invocation is consumed by an external orchestrator that aggregates
//! sweep points into a throughput-vs-K plot.
//!
//! Run is gated by `#[ignore]` because each sweep point cold-loads `K`
//! Stanza workers (~30 s each on a CPU build) and the Stanza Python
//! environment may not be available everywhere.
//!
//! ## How to run
//!
//! Single-point invocation (set `STANZA_PER_KEY` from `1..=9`):
//!
//! ```text
//! STANZA_PER_KEY=7 cargo nextest run -p batchalign \
//!     --test pool_per_key_worker_throughput -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! Each invocation prints exactly one machine-parseable line on
//! stdout:
//!
//! ```text
//! POOL_THROUGHPUT_RESULT,stanza_per_key=K,elapsed_ms=<ms>,\
//!   permit_rejections=<n>,spawn_rejections=<n>,completed=<n>/<total>
//! ```
//!
//! Aggregate those lines across runs to plot the throughput-vs-K
//! curve and locate the knee for a particular host shape.
