//! A relative `-o` must not nest the output directory inside itself.
//!
//! Field report (external user, 2026-08-11): `batchalign3 <cmd> A -o B`
//! produced a second `B` inside `B`. The processed transcripts landed in
//! `B/B/` while the copied non-matching files landed in `B/`, so every run
//! left two output trees and the operator deleted one by hand.
//!
//! The cause was a double join: the discovery pass already roots every
//! output at the requested output directory (`out_dir.join(rel)`), and the
//! writer then rooted the result a second time whenever the path it was
//! handed was relative. An absolute `-o` took the other branch and was
//! always correct, which is why every existing test (all of them using an
//! absolute `tempfile::tempdir()`) passed.
//!
//! This test owns its own process, because cargo builds each integration
//! test file as a separate binary, so it may set the current directory. A
//! relative `-o` has no meaning without a cwd, and the cwd is exactly the
//! axis the defect lived on.
// Integration tests are exempt from the crate's deny-level panic lints,
// matching the src/lib.rs `#![cfg_attr(test, allow(...))]` pattern
// (see docs/panic-audit/).
