//! BUG-028 deeper — global-cap thundering herd.
//!
//! Spawns `max_total_workers + EXTRA` simultaneous dispatch tasks
//! against a pool sized to `max_total_workers`. Under the wake-and-probe
//! design, every worker return wakes ALL parked waiters via
//! `worker_returned.notify_waiters()` at `checkout.rs:105`; each
//! re-probes the global cap and most re-park, generating O(N)
//! rejections per worker return.
//!
//! After the semaphore refactor, FIFO-fair permits should produce only
//! the unavoidable first-attempt rejections (one per oversubscribed
//! caller) plus rare wakeup-races. The post-fix budget below is
//! generous enough to absorb the latter without false-positives, while
//! still failing clearly on the current wake-and-probe design.
//!
//! `test_delay_ms` is set so each worker response takes ~100 ms,
//! forcing all 16 oversubscribed callers to be simultaneously parked
//! before the first worker returns. Without the delay, test-echo
//! workers complete dispatches faster than callers can queue and the
//! herd never forms.
