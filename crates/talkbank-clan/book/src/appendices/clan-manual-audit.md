# CLAN Manual Audit

This appendix tracks how the
[CLAN manual](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CLAN.html) covers the
commands currently implemented in `talkbank-clan`.

The purpose of this audit is to keep the book honest about command intent:

- when the manual has a command section, that section is the starting point for
  legacy semantics
- when the manual is silent or incomplete, the command chapter should say so
  explicitly
- GUI-oriented legacy material should move to the TalkBank VS Code extension docs, not this CLI book

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Section` | The legacy manual has a recognizable standalone command section. |
| `Indirect` | The command is mentioned or implied, but not documented as a standalone section. |
| `Missing` | No clear standalone coverage was found in the legacy manual. |

## Priorities

The next documentation passes should focus on:

1. commands with strong manual semantics that should constrain implementation behavior, especially `CHAINS`, `KEYMAP`, and `RELY`
2. commands whose current docs over-generalize legacy intent, especially `COMBTIER`
3. commands with no standalone `CLAN.html` section, where the book needs to say what evidence is being used instead of pretending the manual is explicit
