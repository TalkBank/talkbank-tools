# Command Status Matrix

Status of all CLAN commands in the Rust reimplementation.

**Coverage: 70/70 CLAN binaries** (100%). Every CLAN binary in `OSX-CLAN/src/unix/bin/` has a corresponding module. The 6 NLP commands (MOR, POST, MEGRASP, etc.) are deliberately not implemented but produce clear error messages. Additionally, 7 implemented commands are outside that local binary inventory: COMPLEXITY, CORELEX, WDSIZE, LAB2CHAT, RTF2CHAT, ROLES, and TRIM.

## Deliberately Not Implemented (6)

These commands depend on the legacy CLAN MOR data model (trie-based lexicons, HMM/Brill taggers, MaxEnt parsers) which is incompatible with the UD-style morphological representation used in the current CHAT grammar. Use batchalign's neural pipeline instead.

| Command | Purpose | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| MOR / MOR_P | Morphological analysis | ~11K lines C, trie lexicon + 5 rule engines, legacy format |
| POST | POS disambiguation | Requires ^-separated ambiguity format not in grammar |
| MEGRASP | Dependency parsing | Requires trained MaxEnt model weights |
| POSTLIST | POST database listing | Operates on proprietary binary format |
| POSTMODRULES | POST rule modification | Operates on proprietary binary format |
| POSTTRAIN | POST model training | Operates on proprietary binary format |

## Subsumed Commands

These CLAN binaries have no dedicated module because their functionality is available through other commands:

| CLAN Binary | Available via |

| GEMFREQ | `freq --gem` |
