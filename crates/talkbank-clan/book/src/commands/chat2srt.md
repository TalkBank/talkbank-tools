# CHAT2SRT -- CHAT to Subtitle Conversion

## Purpose

Converts CHAT files to subtitle format for captioned video. The legacy manual describes `CHAT2SRT` as converting a CHAT file to SRT for video captioning and then walks through a GUI workflow using external subtitle software.

This book focuses on the CLI semantics only: `talkbank-clan` converts timed CHAT utterances to SRT or WebVTT subtitle entries.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan chat2srt input.cha
```

## Output Formats

| Format | Function | Timestamp style |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| SRT    | `chat_to_srt()` | `HH:MM:SS,mmm` |
| WebVTT | `chat_to_vtt()` | `HH:MM:SS.mmm` |

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| *(none)* | | This converter operates on a parsed `ChatFile` and has no additional configuration options. |

## Input Format

Standard CHAT (`.cha`) files with timing bullets on utterances. Utterances without timing bullets are excluded from the output.

## Output

Numbered subtitle blocks with timestamps derived from CHAT timing bullets and cleaned text content (no CHAT markers, annotations, or speaker codes).

Example SRT output:

```
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,500
hello world

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,800
how are you
```

## Differences from CLAN

- **GUI material intentionally omitted here**: The legacy manual's Subtitle Writer walkthrough belongs in the TalkBank VS Code extension docs, not in this CLI command chapter.
- Uses typed AST for subtitle text extraction
- Produces valid, well-formed SRT/WebVTT output
- Additionally supports WebVTT output format
- **Manual feature not yet mirrored**: The legacy manual documents using `+t%glo` to caption from the gloss tier. This chapter should not imply that arbitrary dependent-tier caption sourcing is available unless explicitly implemented.

## Reference

See the [CLAN manual](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CLAN.html#_Toc220409296) for the original CHAT2SRT command documentation.
