# DATACLEAN -- Fix Common CHAT Formatting Errors

## Purpose

Reimplements CLAN's DataCleanUp command, which fixes spacing and formatting issues in CHAT files. Because these are text-level formatting concerns that operate below the AST level, the AST transform is a no-op; the actual logic operates on serialized CHAT text via `clean_chat_text()` and the end-to-end `run_dataclean()` function.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan dataclean file.cha
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--spacing-only` | bool | `false` | Only fix spacing/bracket issues (default: fix everything) |

## Behavior

The following fixes are applied to non-header lines:

- Missing space before `[` brackets
- Missing space after `]` brackets
- Tab characters inside lines (converted to spaces)
- Bare `...` without `+` prefix (converted to `+...`)
- `#long` converted to `##`
- Header lines (`@`-prefixed) are left untouched

## Differences from CLAN

- Operates on serialized text (post-parse) rather than raw input, since these are formatting concerns below the AST level.
- Uses the framework transform pipeline (parse -> transform -> serialize -> text fixups -> write).
