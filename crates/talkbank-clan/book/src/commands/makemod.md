# MAKEMOD -- Generate %mod Tier from Pronunciation Lexicon

## Purpose

Reimplements CLAN's MAKEMOD command, which looks up each countable word on main tiers in a pronunciation lexicon (CMU dictionary format) and generates a `%mod` dependent tier with the phonemic transcription. Words not found in the lexicon are marked with `???`.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan makemod --lexicon-path cmulex.cut file.cha
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--lexicon-path` | path | `cmulex.cut` | Path to the pronunciation lexicon file |
| `--all-alternatives` | bool | `false` | Show all alternative pronunciations (default: first only) |

## External Data

Requires a CMU-format lexicon file (default: `cmulex.cut` from the CLAN `lib/` directory).

Format: `WORD  phoneme1 phoneme2 ...` (one entry per line). Lines starting with `#` or `%` are treated as comments. Words with `(N)` suffix (variant number like `READ(2)`) are treated as pronunciation alternatives for the base word.

## Behavior

For each utterance, the transform:

1. Extracts countable words from the main tier (using the framework's `countable_words()` utility).
2. Looks up each word in the loaded pronunciation lexicon (case-insensitive).
3. Builds a `%mod` dependent tier with the phonemic transcriptions. Words not found are marked `???`.
4. Appends the `%mod` tier to the utterance's dependent tiers.

## Differences from CLAN

- Operates on AST rather than raw text.
- Uses the framework transform pipeline (parse -> transform -> serialize -> write).
