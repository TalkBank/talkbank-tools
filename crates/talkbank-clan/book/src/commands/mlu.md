# MLU -- Mean Length of Utterance

## Purpose

Calculates mean length of utterance in morphemes from the `%mor` tier. When no `%mor` tier is available and not in `--words-only` mode, reports "utterances = 0, morphemes = 0" (matching CLAN behavior -- no fallback to word counting).

See the [CLAN manual](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CLAN.html#_Toc220409094) for the original MLU command specification.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan mlu file.cha
chatter clan mlu --speaker CHI file.cha
chatter clan mlu --words-only file.cha
chatter clan mlu --format json corpus/
```

## Options

| Option | CLAN Flag | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `--speaker <CODE>` | `+t*CHI` | Include speaker |
| `--exclude-speaker <CODE>` | `-t*CHI` | Exclude speaker |
| `--words-only` | -- | Count words from main tier instead of morphemes from %mor |
| `--gem <LABEL>` | `+g"label"` | Restrict to gem segment |
| `--range <START-END>` | `+z25-125` | Utterance range |
| `--format <FMT>` | -- | Output format: text, json, csv, clan |

## CLAN Equivalence

| CLAN command | Rust equivalent |
|---|---|
| `mlu file.cha` | `chatter clan mlu file.cha` |
| `mlu +t*CHI file.cha` | `chatter clan mlu file.cha --speaker CHI` |

## Algorithm

For each utterance with a `%mor` tier:

1. Count **1 per stem** (the base morpheme word)
2. Count **+1 per bound morpheme suffix** -- but ONLY these 7 suffix strings: `PL`, `PAST`, `Past`, `POSS`, `PASTP`, `Pastp`, `PRESP`
3. Count **+1 per clitic stem** (`~` separated)
4. Count clitic suffixes using the same 7-string rule
5. **Fusional features** (`&PRES`, `&INF`, etc.) do NOT count

Per speaker, compute:
- Number of utterances
- Total morphemes
- **MLU** (mean = total morphemes / utterances)
- **Standard deviation** (population SD, dividing by n)
- **Range** (min, max morphemes per utterance)

### Brown's Morpheme Rules

This was a key discovery during parity verification. CLAN only counts 7 specific suffix strings as bound morphemes:

| Suffix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `PL` | Plural |
| `PAST` | Past tense |
| `Past` | Past tense (alternate) |
| `POSS` | Possessive |
| `PASTP` | Past participle |
| `Pastp` | Past participle (alternate) |
| `PRESP` | Present participle |

All other suffixes (including fusional features like `&PRES`, `&INF`, `&3S`) are ignored for MLU counting. This matches Brown's (1973) original operationalization of "morpheme" for child language analysis.

### Example

Given `%mor: pro|I v|want-PAST det|a n|cookie-PL`:

- `pro|I` = 1 stem = **1**
- `v|want-PAST` = 1 stem + 1 suffix (PAST) = **2**
- `det|a` = 1 stem = **1**
- `n|cookie-PL` = 1 stem + 1 suffix (PL) = **2**
- Total: **6 morphemes**

## Output

```
Speaker: CHI
  Utterances: 42
  Morphemes: 168
  MLU: 4.000
  SD: 1.732
  Range: 1-9
```

## Differences from CLAN

### Standard deviation

Uses **population SD** (dividing by n), not sample SD (dividing by n-1). Verified against CLAN output -- CLAN uses population SD too.

### Morpheme counting

Uses parsed `%mor` tier structure (`MorWord` features and post-clitics) rather than text splitting on spaces and delimiters. The semantic result is identical thanks to applying Brown's 7-suffix rule, but the mechanism is type-safe.

### No %mor tier behavior

When no `%mor` tier exists and not in `--words-only` mode, reports 0 utterances for the speaker (matching CLAN). Does not silently fall back to word counting.

### Output formats

Supports text, JSON, and CSV. CLAN produces text only.

### Golden test parity

100% parity with CLAN C binary output.
