# ROLES — Rename Speakers

## Purpose

Renames speaker codes throughout a CHAT file: in `@Participants`, `@ID` headers, and all main-tier speaker prefixes. Used to standardize speaker codes across a corpus.

## Usage

```bash
chatter clan roles --rename "EXP>INV" file.cha
chatter clan roles --rename "Child>CHI" --rename "Mother>MOT" file.cha
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--rename "OLD>NEW"` | Rename speaker OLD to NEW (can be repeated) |

## Behavior

Speaker codes are renamed in all structural locations:
- `@Participants` header entries
- `@ID` header speaker fields
- Main-tier speaker prefixes (`*OLD:` becomes `*NEW:`)

## Differences from CLAN

- Operates on the typed AST rather than raw text.
- Speaker codes are renamed in all structural locations via AST manipulation.
