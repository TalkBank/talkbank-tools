# CLAN Command Divergences & Improvements

This document tracks every divergence between the original CLAN commands and
the Rust `chatter analyze` reimplementation. It covers CLI interface, output
format, counting semantics, error handling, and intentional improvements.

**Audience**: Researchers who have existing CLAN pipelines and need to know
what will change, and developers extending these commands.

**Backward compatibility**: Where CLAN's behavior is well-defined and
pipeline-critical, we aim to provide a `--clan-compat` mode in the future.
Until then, this document serves as the authoritative migration reference.

## Philosophical Divergence

The most fundamental difference between CLAN and `chatter analyze` is not in
any individual command, but in the underlying approach to analysis.

### CLAN: String Matching Without a Data Model

CLAN was written in the late 1970s before the CHAT format had a formal
specification. It operates directly on raw text strings, using character-level
prefix matching to classify content:

```c
// CLAN's approach to excluding non-lexical items (freq.c, mlu.c, etc.)
if (word[0] == '0') continue;     // skip omitted words
if (word[0] == '&') continue;     // skip fillers/nonwords
if (word[0] == '+') continue;     // skip terminators
if (word[0] == '-') continue;     // unclear intent
if (word[0] == '#') continue;     // skip pauses
if (strcmp(word, "xxx") == 0) continue;  // skip unintelligible
if (strcmp(word, "yyy") == 0) continue;  // skip phonetic coding
if (strcmp(word, "www") == 0) continue;  // skip untranscribed
```

This approach is fragile, duplicated across every command, and conflates
string representation with semantic meaning. For example, `&-um` (a filler)
and `&~gaga` (a nonword) and `&+fr` (a phonological fragment) are all lumped
together because they share the `&` prefix, even though they have distinct
linguistic meanings.

### Our Approach: Semantic Classification via AST

Our parser produces a typed AST where each of these categories is a distinct
type. Analysis commands operate on semantic types, not string prefixes:

| CLAN text pattern | Semantic intent | Our AST representation | Analysis filtering |
|---|---|---|---|
| `word[0] == '#'` | Skip pauses | `Pause` (separate AST node) | Tree walk never visits |
| `word[0] == '+'` | Skip terminators | `Terminator` (separate AST level) | Tree walk never visits |
| `&=laughs` | Skip events | `Event` (separate AST node) | Tree walk never visits |
| `word == "xxx"` | Skip unintelligible | `Word { untranscribed: Unintelligible }` | `is_countable_word()` returns false |
| `word == "yyy"` | Skip phonetic coding | `Word { untranscribed: Phonetic }` | `is_countable_word()` returns false |
| `word == "www"` | Skip untranscribed | `Word { untranscribed: Untranscribed }` | `is_countable_word()` returns false |
| `word[0] == '0'` | Skip omitted words | `Word { category: Omission }` | `is_countable_word()` returns false |
| `word[0] == '&'` | Skip fillers/nonwords | `Word { category: Filler\|Nonword\|Fragment }` | `is_countable_word()` returns false |
| `word[0] == '-'` | (unclear) | Not a meaningful CHAT category | Not applicable |

**Key insight**: Pauses, events, actions, and terminators are already separate
AST node types that our tree walk never visits. We only need explicit filtering
on `Word` nodes that carry semantic annotations. The `is_countable_word()`
function in `framework/word_filter.rs` encodes this logic once, and all
analysis commands share it.

### What This Means for Compatibility

The *results* should be equivalent: words that CLAN excludes via string prefix
matching, we exclude via semantic type checking. But the mechanism is
fundamentally different:

- CLAN can be tricked by unusual formatting (e.g., a real word that happens
  to start with `&` due to a transcription error) — our AST only marks words
  as fillers if the parser recognized the `&-` prefix *and* classified them
  as such during parsing.
- CLAN's `word[0] == '-'` exclusion has unclear intent and may exclude
  legitimate content — we omit this because there is no corresponding
  semantic category in CHAT.
- CA (Conversation Analysis) omissions `((word))` are countable in our system
  (they represent uncertain but present speech), matching the linguistic intent
  even though CLAN may exclude them via the `0` prefix check.

## General Framework Divergences

### CLI Syntax

Both legacy CLAN `+flag`/`-flag` and modern `--flag` syntax are accepted.
The CLI auto-translates via `clan_args::rewrite_clan_args()`.

| Aspect | CLAN | `chatter clan` |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Invocation | `freq file.cha` | `chatter clan freq file.cha` |
| Speaker include | `+t*CHI` | `--speaker CHI` |
| Speaker exclude | `-t*INV` | `--exclude-speaker INV` |
| Tier include | `+t%mor` | `--tier mor` |
| Tier exclude | `-t%gra` | `--exclude-tier gra` |
| Word include | `+s"word"` | `--include-word "word"` |
| Word exclude | `-s"word"` | `--exclude-word "word"` |
| Gem include | `+g"Story"` | `--gem "Story"` |
| Gem exclude | `-g"Warmup"` | `--exclude-gem "Warmup"` |
| ID filter | `+t@ID="..."` | `--id-filter "..."` |
| Utterance range | `+z25-125` | `--range 25-125` |
| Include retracings | `+r6` | `--include-retracings` |
| Case-sensitive | `+k` | `--case-sensitive` |
| Display mode | `+dN` | `--display-mode N` |
| Output to file | `+fEXT` | `--output-ext EXT` |
| Context window | `+wN` / `-wN` | `--context-after N` / `--context-before N` |
| Merge across files | `+u` | Default behavior (always on) |
| Output format | Text only | `--format text\|json\|csv\|clan` |
| Multiple files | `freq *.cha` (glob) | `chatter clan freq dir/` (recursive) |

### Output Envelope

CLAN wraps output in a verbose envelope (command echo, timestamp, filter
summary). `chatter clan` uses `render_clan()` for CLAN-compatible output
format and `render_text()` for clean output. The envelope is omitted in
both modes — the information is available via shell history and `date`.

### Error Handling

| Behavior | CLAN | `chatter clan` |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Unparseable file | Prints error, continues | Logs warning (via `tracing`), continues |
| No `.cha` files found | Varies by command | Prints error, exits with code 1 |
| Missing %mor tier | Skips silently | Reports 0 utterances (MLU), skips (FREQ `--mor`) |

### Multi-File Aggregation

| Behavior | CLAN | `chatter clan` |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Default | Per-file output | Merged across files |
| Merged | Requires `+u` flag | Default behavior |

### File Output

CLAN's `+f` flag writes output to auto-named files (e.g., `sample.frq.cex`).
`chatter analyze` always writes to stdout. Use shell redirection:

```bash
# CLAN:
freq +f sample.cha              # -> sample.frq.cex

# chatter:
chatter analyze freq sample.cha > sample.frq.txt
chatter analyze freq sample.cha --format json > sample.frq.json
```

## Key Discoveries

These findings were established during parity verification (golden tests
comparing against CLAN C binaries):

1. **Brown's Morpheme Rules**: CLAN MLU/WDLEN count only 7 suffix strings as
   bound morphemes: `PL`, `PAST`, `Past`, `POSS`, `PASTP`, `Pastp`, `PRESP`.

2. **Population SD**: Both MLU and MLT use population SD (/ n), not sample (/ n-1).

3. **MLT SD basis**: Computed over per-utterance word counts, not per-turn totals.

4. **DIST turns**: Every utterance is its own turn (no speaker-continuity grouping).

5. **WDLEN morphemes**: Section 5 = stem + Brown's suffix (no POS). Section 6 =
   POS + stem + Brown's suffix. Clitic pairs = one word in section 5, POS counted
   only for main word in section 6.

6. **WDLEN characters**: CLAN strips apostrophes before counting character length.

7. **Speaker ordering**: CLAN outputs speakers in reverse encounter order (linked-list
   prepend pattern from the C implementation).

8. **Fusional features**: `&PRES`, `&INF` etc. are stored as part of the lemma string
   in our model (for roundtrip fidelity). Strip with `split('&')` when needed.

9. **CHIP echo**: CLAN echoes main tiers + %mor only, not %gra tiers.
