//! Mapping between CLAN CHECK error numbers and our error codes.
//!
//! CLAN CHECK uses a flat numbering system (1–161) defined in `check.cpp`.
//! This module provides bidirectional mapping between those numbers and our
//! typed `ErrorCode` variants.
//!
//! # Divergences
//!
//! Not all CHECK errors have direct equivalents — some are obsolete (e.g.,
//! error 96 "Word color is now illegal"), some are subsumed by our parser's
//! structural validation, and some check conditions we handle differently.
//! Unmapped errors return number 0.

use talkbank_model::codes::ErrorCode;

/// Map our `ErrorCode` to the closest CHECK error number (1–161).
///
/// Returns 0 if there is no direct CHECK equivalent.
