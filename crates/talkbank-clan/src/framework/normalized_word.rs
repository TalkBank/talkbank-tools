//! Normalized word text for use as frequency-counting map keys.
//!
//! The transformation `word.cleaned_text().to_lowercase()` is the canonical
//! form used as map keys across all analysis commands. [`NormalizedWord`]
//! encapsulates this transformation so it is always applied consistently
//! across FREQ, MAXWD, DIST, COOCCUR, KWAL, COMBO, and all other commands
//! that need word-level deduplication or matching.
//!
//! [`clan_display_form()`] provides an alternative form that preserves `+` in
//! compound words (`ice+cream`) for CLAN-compatible output rendering.
//!
//! # Forward-compatibility
//!
//! As the grammar moves toward a looser `grammar.js` that pushes more checks
//! from parsing into validation, words that previously would not reach the AST
//! may start arriving as less-classified `Word` nodes. Centralizing the
//! normalization here means only [`NormalizedWord::from_word()`] needs updating
//! when that happens -- no command code changes are required.
