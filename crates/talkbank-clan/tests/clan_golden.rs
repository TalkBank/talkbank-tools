//! Golden tests comparing talkbank-clan output against CLAN CLI output.
//!
//! These tests are split by concern:
//! - `harness` contains shared CLAN/Rust execution helpers and generated test runners
//! - `baseline`, `check`, and `variants_*` declare manifest-style parity cases
//! - `rust_only` keeps bespoke temp-file coverage alongside simple manifest-driven snapshots
