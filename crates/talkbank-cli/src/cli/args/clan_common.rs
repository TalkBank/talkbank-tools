//! Shared clap argument groups for CLAN analysis commands.
//!
//! This module keeps the CLI-facing flag surface small and typed. In
//! particular, `--range` now parses directly into the library-owned
//! [`talkbank_clan::framework::UtteranceRange`] model so the CLI stops carrying
//! raw `start-end` strings past argument parsing.
