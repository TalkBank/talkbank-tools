//! Named-constant Unicode codepoints used throughout CHAT structural
//! syntax and CHAT validation.
//!
//! Several non-ASCII codepoints carry stable, load-bearing meaning in
//! CHAT — quotation-group bookends, tag and vocative separators,
//! curly-quote characters CLAN's `check` flags as illegal — and they
//! were previously inlined as bare `'\u{201C}'`-style char literals at
//! every use site across `talkbank-model`, `talkbank-parser`,
//! `talkbank-clan`, the re2c parser, and the downstream
//! `batchalign-chat-ops` ASR pipeline. That scatter made the
//! codepoints' CHAT semantics invisible at the call site (a reader
//! had to know `\u{201C}` is "the structural quotation-begin
//! character") and made grep-by-name impossible.
//!
//! This module is the single home for those codepoints. Each constant
//! is named after its Unicode designation; the doc comment explains
//! the CHAT role.
//!
//! # Why not an enum
//!
//! These are not a closed set with switching behavior — they're
//! lookup names. Several of them are written by serializers that need
//! a `char` directly (`w.write_char(LEFT_DOUBLE_QUOTE)`); a `match`
//! against a discriminant adds friction without clarifying anything.
//! Named `pub const char` matches the way the codepoints are actually
//! used.
