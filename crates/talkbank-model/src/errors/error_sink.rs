//! Core diagnostic sink trait plus lightweight forwarding implementations.
//!
//! Parsers and validators stream diagnostics through [`ErrorSink`] so call sites
//! can choose how to consume them without changing parsing logic. This module
//! keeps the interface itself and the minimal stateless or forwarding sink
//! implementations that are closest to that interface.

/// Trait for receiving errors as they are discovered during parsing or validation.
///
/// All parse and validation methods accept an `&impl ErrorSink` so that
/// diagnostics are streamed out immediately rather than accumulated in a
/// return value. This keeps parsers composable: a caller can choose to
/// collect errors (`ErrorCollector`),
/// count them (`ParseTracker`),
/// forward them over a channel (`ChannelErrorSink`), or discard them
/// (`NullErrorSink`).
///
/// Implementations must be `Send + Sync` because parsers may report
/// errors from multiple threads (e.g., during parallel file validation).
///
/// The `&T` blanket impl means shared references (`&sink`) also satisfy
/// `ErrorSink`, so callers never need to wrap sinks in `Arc`.

    /// forward, or discard).
