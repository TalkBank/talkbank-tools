//! Scoped annotation types for CHAT transcripts.
//!
//! Scoped annotations provide additional information about words, phrases, or utterances.
//! They are enclosed in square brackets `[marker text]` and appear within or after
//! the content they annotate.
//!
//! This module re-exports both data types and formatter logic so callers can
//! treat scoped annotations as first-class typed nodes.
//!
//! # Common Annotations
//!
//! - **Errors**: `[*]` or `[* code]` - Mark speech errors or corrections needed
//! - **Explanations**: `[= text]` - Clarify unclear or ambiguous utterances
//! - **Retracing**: `[/]`, `[//]`, `[///]` - Mark repeated or self-corrected words
//! - **Overlaps**: `[<]`, `[>]` - Mark simultaneous speech by multiple speakers
//! - **Additions**: `[+ text]` - Add clarifying information
