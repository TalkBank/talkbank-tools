/// Content items that can appear on the main tier of a CHAT utterance.

/// This enum represents all possible content between the speaker code and terminator
/// on a main tier. Content items can be simple (words, events, pauses) or complex
/// (annotated items, groups with nested content).
///
/// # CHAT Format Examples
///
/// ```text
/// *CHI: I want cookie .                    Word variants
/// *CHI: I want [* m] cookie .              AnnotatedWord
/// *CHI: I want [: need] cookie .           ReplacedWord
/// *CHI: <I want> [/] I need it .           Group, AnnotatedGroup
/// *CHI: the dog &=barks loudly .           Event
/// *CHI: um (.) yeah (1.5) okay .           Pause
/// *CHI: ‹hello there› !                    PhoGroup
/// *CHI: 〔wave goodbye〕 .                  SinGroup
/// *CHI: "I said hello" .                   Quotation
/// *CHI: [^ note] yeah .                    Freecode
/// *CHI: well , you know .                  Separator (CA mode)

/// # Annotation Patterns
///
/// Several content types have both "bare" and "annotated" variants:
/// - `Word` / `AnnotatedWord` - word with scoped annotations like `[* m]`, `[= explanation]`
/// - `Event` / `AnnotatedEvent` - event with annotations
/// - `Group` / `AnnotatedGroup` - group with scoped annotations like `[/]`, `[//]`
///
/// The `Annotated<T>` wrapper adds scoped annotations to any annotatable type.
