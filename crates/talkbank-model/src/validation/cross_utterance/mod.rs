//! Cross-utterance validation for quotation patterns and completion linkers
//!
//! This module validates relationships between utterances that require looking
//! at sequences of utterances, particularly:
//! - Quotation patterns (Pattern A: +"/. and Pattern B: +". )
//! - Completion linkers (+, and ++)
//!
//! ## Disabled Validations
//!
//! **NOTE**: All quotation marker cross-utterance validations are currently **DISABLED** (2025-12-28).
//!
//! ### Rationale
//! The legacy CHAT system (Java) never performed validation of these cross-utterance patterns.
//! These validations were implemented fresh in the Rust version to enforce strict CHAT
//! conventions for quoted passages and completion sequences. However, analysis of real-world
//! corpora (particularly CORAAL, OralArguments) shows that these strict sequential patterns
//! don't match natural conversational flow:
//!
//! - **E341**: Quotation follows (`+"/. `) - Requires next same-speaker utterance to have `+"` linker.
//!   Fails when speakers don't continue with quoted content or other speakers interject.
//!
//! - **E344**: Quotation precedes (`+".`) - Requires preceding same-speaker utterances with `+"` linkers.
//!   Fails when quoted content appears without preceding marked utterances.
//!
//! - **E346**: Quoted utterance linker (`+"`) - Requires upstream/downstream same-speaker
//!   utterances to end with `+"/` or `+".` respectively. Fails when attorneys interrupt
//!   or continue quoted passages in non-canonical ways.
//!
//! - **E352**: Self-completion linker (`+,`) - Requires preceding same-speaker utterance
//!   to end with `+/.` (interruption). Fails when speakers resume utterances in
//!   natural conversation without interruption markers.
//!
//! ### Decision
//! Rather than relax or modify these validations (which could introduce new bugs), we're
//! temporarily disabling them to allow corpus-wide roundtrip testing. This lets us:
//!
//! 1. Make progress on roundtrip testing across all 807 corpora
//! 2. Collect real data on how these patterns actually appear in various CHAT corpora
//! 3. Later make an informed decision on validation approach:
//!    - Should these be warnings, not errors?
//!    - Should they be context-sensitive (different rules for different corpus types)?
//!    - Should we relax the sequential pattern matching?
//!    - Should we restore the old behavior (no validation)?
//!
//! ### Files with Disabled Logic
//! - `quotation_follows.rs`: check_quotation_follows() - DISABLED (E341)
//! - `quotation_precedes.rs`: check_quotation_precedes() - DISABLED (E344)
//! - `quoted_linker.rs`: check_quoted_linker() - DISABLED (E346)
//! - `completion.rs`: check_self_completion() - DISABLED (E352)
//! - `completion.rs`: check_other_completion() - DISABLED (E349/E350)
