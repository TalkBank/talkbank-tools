//! Temporal validation for media bullets
//!
//! Implements CLAN CHECK command temporal constraints:
//! - E701 (Error 83): Per-speaker start-time monotonicity
//! - E704 (Error 133): Per-speaker overlap with 500ms tolerance
//! - E729 (Error 84): Cross-speaker overlap (opt-in only, CLAN `+c0`)
//!
//! E729 is NOT part of default validation. CLAN only fires error 84 when the
//! user passes `+c0` to CHECK, enabling strict timeline contiguity mode (which
//! also fires error 85 for gaps). In normal conversational transcripts,
//! cross-speaker overlap is ubiquitous and expected.
//!
//! Note: E702/E703 (strict timeline mode) are reserved for future use.
