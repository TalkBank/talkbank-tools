//! Overlap validation functions.
//!
//! Validates CA overlap markers (⌈⌉⌊⌋) within individual utterances:
//! - **E373**: Invalid overlap index (must be 2-9 if present)
//! - **E348**: Unpaired overlap marker (opening without closing or vice versa)
//!
//! Uses [`extract_overlap_info`] from `alignment::helpers::overlap` for the
//! content traversal — same traversal used by the alignment pipeline,
//! eliminating duplicated walk logic.
//!
//! Cross-utterance checks (E347 unbalanced across speakers, E704 self-overlap)
//! are in `validation/cross_utterance/`.
