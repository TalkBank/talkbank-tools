//! Utterance segmentation helpers.
//!
//! Splits a single utterance into multiple utterances based on word-level
//! assignments from a segmentation callback.
//!
//! Also provides types and functions for the server-side utseg orchestrator:
//! payload collection, cache key computation, and result application.
//!
//! ## Outcome model
//!
//! Every utterance visited by `collect_utseg_payloads` + `apply_utseg_results`
//! produces exactly one [`UtsegOutcome`]. This is the sibling-task analog of
//! morphotag's [`MorOutcome`](crate::morphosyntax::outcome::MorOutcome) and
//! serves the same architectural purpose: making correct-by-design behavior
//! (e.g. single-word utterances that trivially need no segmentation) visible
//! as a typed `NotApplicable` outcome rather than invisible silent skip, and
//! making worker-response shape mismatches fail loudly as typed
//! `MisalignmentBug` diagnostics rather than being absorbed by defensive
//! index guards in `split_utterance`.
//!
//! The utseg invariant is simpler than morphotag's: there is no tokenizer
//! realignment stage — the Python utseg worker is a per-word classifier
//! whose `assignments` return MUST have the same length as the input
//! `words`. A mismatch is always a worker-contract bug, not an expected
//! divergence class.
