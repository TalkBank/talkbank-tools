# Grammar Precedence Decisions

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-03-24 07:45 EDT

This document records non-obvious grammar design decisions, particularly
around tree-sitter precedence and disambiguation. These decisions were
validated empirically with minimal proof grammars before being applied
to the full CHAT grammar.

## Zero (Omission) Disambiguation

### Problem

CHAT uses `0` in two ways:
- **`0word`** (no space): one omitted word — `0die` means "omitted 'die'"
- **`0 word`** (with space): standalone action marker + separate word

Tree-sitter must distinguish these at parse time because editors, LSP,
and syntax highlighting depend on the correct CST structure.

### Constraint: `extras: []`

The CHAT grammar uses `extras: $ => []` — **no implicit whitespace**.
Whitespace is explicit (`$.whitespaces`, `$.space`) and appears as named
nodes in the CST. This means tree-sitter does NOT skip whitespace between
tokens. This is critical for the zero disambiguation:

- `0die`: `zero` and `word_body` are adjacent → standalone_word matches
- `0 die`: space between `zero` and `die` → standalone_word can't match
  (word_body requires immediate adjacency), so `zero` falls to `nonword`

### Constraint: Precedence Doesn't Propagate Through Intermediate Rules

**Proven empirically.** When `zero` is referenced through an intermediate
rule (`word_prefix`), tree-sitter's shift-reduce resolution ignores the
outer rule's precedence. The parser always reduces `zero` to `nonword`
instead of shifting it into `word_prefix → standalone_word`.

Minimal proof grammar (works — zero directly in word):
```javascript
word: $ => prec(6, seq(optional($.zero), $.word_body)),
action: $ => prec(1, $.zero),
```

Same grammar with indirection (BROKEN — action always wins):
```javascript
word: $ => prec(6, seq(optional($.word_prefix), $.word_body)),
word_prefix: $ => $.zero,  // indirection breaks prec propagation
action: $ => prec(1, $.zero),
```

The full proof grammar is at `/tmp/tree-sitter-zero-test/grammar.js`
(experiments 1–5).

### Solution

Inline `$.zero` directly into `standalone_word` instead of going through
`word_prefix`:

```javascript
standalone_word: $ => prec.right(6, seq(
  optional(choice($.word_prefix, $.zero)),  // zero inlined, not via word_prefix
  $.word_body,
  ...
)),

nonword: $ => prec(1, choice($.event, $.zero)),
```

- `prec(6)` on standalone_word beats `prec(1)` on nonword
- When tree-sitter sees `zero • word_body`, it shifts (standalone_word wins)
- When `zero` is followed by space, only nonword can match
- `&-`, `&~`, `&+` stay in `word_prefix` (no conflict — `&` is excluded
  from `word_segment`)

### Data validation

Standalone `0` in real CHAT data (from `data/*-data/`):
- **~18.7M** utterance-initial (`*CHI:\t0 .`)
- **~15.5K** mid-utterance (`yeah 0 [=! pops mouth]`)
- Appears after linkers: `+" 0 [% makes knocking sound]`
- **Not** restricted to utterance-initial position

## Word Segment Purity Invariant

**`word_segment` contains ONLY pure spoken text.** No structural markers,
no control characters, no prosodic annotations. Everything else is a
separate typed child in `word_body`.

This is a hard invariant, enforced by:
1. **Grammar:** Character exclusions in `word_segment` regex
2. **TDD gate:** `grammar/test/corpus/word/word_segment_purity.txt` (8 tests)
3. **Model (planned):** `WordText::new()` will reject banned characters

### Character Exclusion Source of Truth

Exclusions are built from the **symbol registry** (`src/generated_symbol_sets.js`),
NOT hand-written in the regex. The grammar imports:

```javascript
const WORD_SEGMENT_FORBIDDEN_FIRST = WORD_SEGMENT_FORBIDDEN_START_BASE
  + CA_ALL_SYMBOLS + WORD_SEGMENT_FORBIDDEN_COMMON + '0';
const WORD_SEGMENT_FORBIDDEN_REST = WORD_SEGMENT_FORBIDDEN_REST_BASE
  + CA_ALL_SYMBOLS + WORD_SEGMENT_FORBIDDEN_COMMON;
```

### What is excluded

| Category | Characters | Becomes |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Overlap markers | ⌈⌉⌊⌋ | `overlap_point` in `word_body` |
| CA elements | ↑↓≠∾⁑⤇∙Ἡ↻⤆ | `ca_element` in `word_body` |
| CA delimiters | ∆∇°▁▔☺♋⁇∬Ϋ∮↫⁎◉§ | `ca_delimiter` in `word_body` |
| Stress markers | ˈˌ | `stress_marker` in `word_body` |
| Colons | : | `lengthening` in `word_body` |
| Underline markers | \x02\x01, \x02\x02 | `underline_begin`/`underline_end` in `word_body` |
| Brackets | []<>(){} | structural (annotations, groups) |
| Punctuation | .!?,;+ | terminators, separators, compound |
| CHAT prefixes | @$&*% | headers, events, speakers |
| Intonation contours | ⇗↗→↘⇘≈≋∞≡ | content-level markers |
| Group delimiters | ‹›""〔〕 | pho/sin groups, quotes |
| Control chars | \x01-\x08, \x15 | bullets, underline |

### First-char-only exclusion

`0` is excluded from the first character only (omission prefix).
`200`, `h0me` are valid because `0` can appear in non-initial positions.

### Historical note

The pre-coarsening grammar (saved as `docs/pre-coarsening-grammar.js.reference`)
had all these markers as `word_content` children. When `standalone_word` was
coarsened to an opaque token, the exclusions were lost — the Chumsky direct
parser handled them in Rust. The structured word grammar restores the
grammar-level exclusions using the symbol registry as the single source
of truth.

## Multi-Root Grammar

`source_file` is a `choice()` of fragment types at different precedences:

```javascript
source_file: $ => choice(
  prec(3, $.full_document),     // @UTF8...@Begin...@End
  prec(2, $.utterance),         // main tier + dependent tiers
  prec(1, $.main_tier),         // *SPEAKER:\tcontent terminator
  prec(1, $.dependent_tier),    // %tier:\tcontent
  prec(1, $.header),            // @Header:\tcontent
  prec(1, $.pre_begin_header),  // @PID, @Font, @Window, @Color
  prec(0, $.standalone_word),   // single word token
),
```

This enables parsing any CHAT fragment (line, word, tier) directly
without constructing a synthetic `@UTF8...@Begin...@End` wrapper.

**Cost:** +1.3% parser size. **Benefit:** eliminates all synthetic
document wrappers from `parse_word`, `parse_main_tier`, etc.

## DFA Token Precedence Changes

The structured word grammar introduced `lengthening` at `prec(5)`:

```javascript
lengthening: $ => token(prec(5, /:{1,}/)),
colon: $ => ':',  // prec 0
```

In ERROR recovery contexts, tree-sitter's DFA now produces `lengthening`
instead of `colon` for `:` characters. This affects error test
expectations (e.g., E307 participants header error) but not correct
parsing.

## Colon Disambiguation: Parser-Level Filtering

### Problem

`:` means both "lengthening" inside words (`no::`) and "separator" between
words (`hello : world`). The DFA always produces `lengthening` (prec 5)
for `:`, regardless of context.

### Solution: Constrain the parser, not the DFA

Don't fight the DFA token choice. Instead, restrict the grammar rules so
`lengthening` is only accepted where it makes linguistic sense:

```javascript
// word_body MUST start with word_segment, shortening, or stress_marker.
// lengthening and + cannot be first.
word_body: $ => prec.right(seq(
  choice($.word_segment, $.shortening, $.stress_marker),  // required first
  repeat(choice($.word_segment, $.shortening, $.stress_marker, $.lengthening, '+')),
)),
```

When the DFA produces `lengthening` for standalone `:`, the parser tries
`standalone_word(word_body(lengthening))`. But `word_body` rejects
`lengthening` as a first element → `standalone_word` fails → parser falls
through to `separator(colon)`.

For `no::`, `word_segment("no")` starts the word body, so
`lengthening("::")` follows naturally in the `repeat(...)`.

### General Pattern

**When a DFA token has multiple meanings depending on position:**
1. Let the DFA produce whichever token wins by precedence
2. Constrain the PARSER rules so the token is only accepted in valid positions
3. The parser's structural rules act as a filter on the DFA's token choice

This is the same principle behind the zero disambiguation: the DFA always
produces `zero` for `0`, but the parser structure determines whether it
becomes `standalone_word(zero, word_body)` or `nonword(zero)`.

### Validated cases

| Input | Result | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| `no::` | `word_segment("no") + lengthening("::")` | word_segment starts body |
| `hello : world` | `separator(colon)` | `:` can't start word_body |
| `ˈhello` | `stress_marker + word_segment` | stress_marker can start body |
| `(be)cause` | `shortening + word_segment` | shortening can start body |
| `°↑ho:v°` | `ca_delimiter + ca_element + word_segment + lengthening + word_segment + ca_delimiter` | marker-initial path; `:` is lengthening inside word |
| `*CHI:` | speaker `colon` | different grammar path entirely |

### Lint Investigation (2026-03-24)

The static grammar linter correctly reports that `lengthening` (prec 5,
`:{1,}`) shadows `colon` (prec 0, `:`) at the DFA level. The corpus
analysis confirmed 414,244 `:` tokens classified as `lengthening` in
`word_body`.

**Conclusion: behaviorally benign.** All 414,244 are correct — they are
real prosodic lengthening inside words (`ho:v`, `he:em`, `stja:l`, etc.).
The shadow cannot cause incorrect behavior because:

1. `lengthening` can never start a `word_body` (required first element is
   `word_segment`, `shortening`, `stress_marker`, or structural marker)
2. Standalone `:` fails `word_body` → falls through to `separator(colon)`
3. The ERROR nodes in the corpus report were from the stacked CA marker
   bug (now fixed), not from colon misclassification

The DFA shadow is real but harmless — the parser-level rules filter it.

## Full Linter Investigation Summary (2026-03-24)

Static grammar lint (`tree-sitter-grammar-utils lint`) reported 34
high-severity findings. Corpus analysis (`corpus-analyze`) on 99,907
files confirmed empirical impact. Investigation results:

### Token Shadows (6 warnings)

| Finding | Verdict | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `lengthening` shadows `colon` | **Benign** | Parser-level rules filter; 414K correct lengthening in corpus, 0 misclassified colons |
| `zero` shadows `sin_word`/`speaker` | **Benign** | No speaker `0` or %sin word `0` in 99,907-file corpus |
| `ethnicity_value`/`ses_code_value` shadow `generic_id_ses` | **Intentional** | Strict+catch-all pattern by design |
| `x_dependent_tier` shadows `unsupported_dependent_tier` | **Intentional** | Strict+catch-all pattern by design |

### Degenerate Rules (5 warnings)

| Finding | Verdict | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `contents` matches bare `overlap_point` | **Acceptable** | CA transcription can have `⌈` as sole content; structural overlap marking |
| `free_text` matches bare `continuation` | **Benign** | No real-data occurrences |
| `header_gap` matches bare space/tab | **Correct** | A header gap IS just whitespace |
| `text_with_bullets` / `text_with_bullets_and_pics` | **Benign** | No real-data occurrences of bare continuation |

### Precedence Non-Propagation (23 warnings)

| Finding | Verdict | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `standalone_word`(prec 6) → `word_body` (21) | **Harmless** | prec(6) is for rule-level zero disambiguation only; word_body children use token(prec(10)) for DFA disambiguation; GLR conflicts declared in `conflicts` array |
| `nonword`(prec 1) → `event` (2) | **Harmless** | `event_marker` (`&=`) is structurally distinct; no competing rules |

### Bugs Found and Fixed

| Finding | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `overlap_point` regex `[2-9]?` excluded digit 1 | Changed to `[1-9]?`; E373 validates range |
| `word_body` marker-initial path: single marker only | Changed to `repeat1`; stacked CA markers (°↑, °°) now parse correctly |

These two grammar bugs caused 75 of 76 samtale-data validation failures
(3,806 ERROR nodes). After the fixes, only 2 files have errors across all
data repos (both data quality issues, not grammar bugs).
