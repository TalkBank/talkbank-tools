# The NO-NETWORK half of the dashboard API drift gate: `openapi.json` is
# generated FROM the Rust types, so a doc-comment or a `required` change
# regenerates it and the committed copy goes stale.
#
# Why this exists as its own script. The whole check
# (`check_dashboard_api_drift.sh`) also runs `npx openapi-typescript`, which
# needs the npm-installed frontend, and it was EXEMPT from the pre-push gate
# for that reason. True of the TypeScript half, irrelevant to this half: the
# schema reuses a development binary whose freshness Cargo has proved.
#
# That exemption is what let a stale `openapi.json` reach main on 2026-08-27.
# Making `HealthResponse::status` required and rewriting two doc comments
# changed the generated schema; every local gate passed and CI failed on
# `Verify dashboard API artifacts`. The same shape as
# `batchalign-ipc-schema-check`, which was exempt for "needs the built binary"
# and is now in the hook for exactly this reason.
#
# Regenerate both halves with `scripts/generate_dashboard_api_types.sh`.
