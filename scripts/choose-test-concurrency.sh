# choose-test-concurrency.sh: compute a safe parallelism for a test
# profile based on available RAM.
#
# Part of Phase A4 of the test-cost revamp (2026-04-23).
# Budget arithmetic, not machine tiers: we leave 40% of RAM for OS +
# editor + browser, then divide the remainder by the profile's peak
# resident-set estimate to get a safe jobs count.
#
# Usage:
#   jobs=$(bash scripts/choose-test-concurrency.sh default)
#   cargo test -p batchalign -- --test-threads "$jobs"
#
# The usage line named the nextest runner until 2026-07-30. That runner is
# banned and uninstalled in this workspace, so following the instruction
# produced "no such command"; the profile names below survive as memory-budget
# labels, which is all this script ever computed.
#
# Output: a single integer on stdout; caller captures.
#
# Profiles (memory-budget labels, matching the documented worker budgets;
# formerly also the names of nextest test-groups):
#   default: pure Rust lib/unit tests, no ML models          ~1 GB
#   ml: loads Stanza + friends into the test process   ~12 GB
#   gpu: loads Whisper (FA / ASR)                        ~6 GB
#   stress: concurrent dispatch test, shared state pressure  ~4 GB
#   python: pytest without golden marker, no models         ~1 GB
#
# The 128 GB hard-refuse guard for golden + xdist in
# batchalign/tests/conftest.py is correctness (OOM prevention) and
# stays: this script handles tuning below that ceiling.
