# E353: MissingOtherCompletionContext

## Description

An other-completion linker (`++`) was used but it is the very first
utterance in the file. The `++` linker requires a preceding utterance
(from a different speaker) to complete.

## Metadata

- **Error Code**: E353
- **Category**: cross\_utterance
- **Level**: utterance
- **Layer**: validation
- **Status**: implemented

## Example 1

**Trigger**: ++ other-completion as the very first utterance in the file

```chat
@UTF8
@Begin
@Languages:	eng
@Participants:	CHI Target_Child
@ID:	eng|test|CHI||male|||Target_Child|||
*CHI:	++ hello .
@End
```

## Expected Behavior

Validation should report E353. The `++` linker signals other-completion
(completing a different speaker's utterance), but there is no preceding
utterance at all — this is the first utterance in the file.

## CHAT Rule

The `++` linker pairs with `+...` (trailing off). A preceding utterance
from a different speaker must have trailed off for another speaker to
complete it.
