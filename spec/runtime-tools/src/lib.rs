//! Runtime-aware specification tooling.
//!
//! This crate contains post-generation tooling that needs the live Rust
//! parser/model crates. These tools are intentionally separate from
//! `spec/tools`, which should stay usable without pulling runtime parser/model
//! dependencies into ordinary spec generation workflows.
//!
//! Kept binaries:
//! - `extract_corpus_candidates` — find representative CHAT files for corpus curation
//! - `validate_error_specs` — validate error spec layer classification
//!
//! The bootstrap and mining machinery was removed (2026-03-22) — the grammar
//! is stable and specs are now manually curated.
