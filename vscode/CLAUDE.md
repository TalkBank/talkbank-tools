# VS Code Extension — TalkBank CHAT Editor

**Status:** Current
**Last updated:** 2026-04-16 16:19 EDT

All user, developer, and integrator documentation lives in **`book/`**
(mdBook, hosted alongside the other TalkBank books — see
`../../docs/inventory.md` §2). The book is the single source of truth for
this extension: installation, every mode (transcription, walker, coder,
review), every feature, architecture, developer on-ramp, and custom LSP
RPC contract reference. `book/src/introduction.md` is the entry point;
`book/src/SUMMARY.md` is the table of contents.

`README.md` is the marketplace-facing summary (what a user sees on the
VS Code Marketplace listing); it is a short feature overview plus a
pointer into the book. Do not grow it into a second manual — every
non-trivial addition belongs in a book chapter. Keep this directory
free of loose `.md` docs; if the book doesn't yet cover a topic, add
a book chapter.

## Overview

VS Code extension providing real-time validation, CLAN analysis, media playback,
transcription mode, waveform visualization, dependency graphs, and speaker filtering
for CHAT format files. Backed by the `talkbank-lsp` Rust binary over stdio.

## The hard rule: no domain logic in this extension

This extension is a **presentation and workflow layer** over `talkbank-lsp`.
The Rust side owns parsing, validation, alignment, CHAT serialization, CLAN
command semantics, and every other piece of CHAT domain knowledge. The
TypeScript side owns webview layout, command wiring, keybindings, state
machines for coder/review/transcription/walker modes, and VS Code API
integration.

**Concretely, this extension must NOT:**

- Re-parse CHAT text (`bulletParser.ts` is a narrow stopgap for timing
  bullets only, documented as such — do not expand it).
- Re-implement any alignment between tiers. Main ↔ `%mor`, `%mor` ↔ `%gra`,
  `%pho`, `%sin`, `%wor` alignment all live in `talkbank-model`. The LSP
  exposes the computed alignment via hover, highlights, alignment sidecar
  JSON (`alignmentSidecar.ts` just decodes the sidecar into segment
  objects — it does not derive alignment). If a webview panel needs
  cross-tier information, request it from the LSP; never derive it from
  the document text on the client.
- Classify CHAT constructs by pattern-matching on serialized strings.
  Routinely, this is a bug: the CHAT grammar has subtle context (CA
  markers, retraces, overlap groups, compound words) that defeats regex.
  If a feature needs to know what kind of thing is under the cursor, the
  LSP can answer via semantic tokens, hover, or a custom RPC endpoint —
  add the endpoint rather than re-implement the classification in TS.
- Hold persistent domain state (open files, validation results, parsed
  ASTs) outside the LSP. Per-session VS Code state (panel positions,
  review ratings, coder progress) is fine; CHAT semantics is not.

The bug that motivated adding this rule (2026-04-16): a `%gra` hover in
`talkbank-lsp` re-walked mor items by hand instead of using the canonical
chunk sequence in `talkbank-model`, silently showing the wrong stem on
post-clitics. The extension itself was clean, but the principle applies
doubly here — the TypeScript side is one more layer away from the
grammar and model source of truth, so the cost of reconstructing domain
semantics is higher still.

## LSP Binary Discovery

`findLspBinary()` searches: system PATH (via `which`) → `target/debug/` → `target/release/`.

## Webview Pattern

All panels use singleton pattern (`createOrShow`). Communication via PostMessage JSON
protocol (rewind, setLoop, seekTo, segmentChanged).

## Analysis Commands (33 total)

All 33 CLAN commands are wired: freq, mlu, mlt, wdlen, wdsize, maxwd, freqpos, timedur,
gemlist, cooccur, dist, chip, phonfreq, modrep, vocd, codes, complexity, corelex, chains,
dss, eval, flucalc, ipsyn, kideval, sugar, trnfix, uniq + 6 requiring user input (kwal,
combo, keymap, mortable, script, rely).

## Dependencies

- `vscode-languageclient@9.0.1` — LSP client
- `@hpcc-js/wasm@2.29.0` — Graphviz WASM
- TypeScript 5.9, ESLint, Vitest

## Detailed Documentation

`book/src/introduction.md` as the entry point; `book/src/SUMMARY.md`
lists every chapter.

High-traffic sections for newcomers:

- `book/src/getting-started/installation.md` — install a platform VSIX
- `book/src/developer/architecture.md` — three-layer design
- `book/src/developer/lsp-protocol.md` — LSP surface + custom RPC
- `book/src/navigation/alignment.md` — cross-tier alignment behavior
