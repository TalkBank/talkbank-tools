# Assessment Tools

**Last updated:** 2026-03-30 16:35 EDT

The assessment tools — KidEval, Eval, and Eval-D — compare a
speaker's language measures against normative databases. Instead of
reporting raw numbers (MLU = 3.2), they tell you how that number
compares to age-matched peers (z-score = -1.5, below average).

These tools have dedicated commands and panels, separate from the
general CLAN analysis picker. They are the primary workflow for
clinical assessment and research benchmarking.

## KidEval — Child Language Assessment

KidEval computes a battery of language measures (MLU, MLT, VOCD, DSS,
IPSyn, and others) and compares each against normative data from
age-matched, typically developing children.

### How to run KidEval

1. Open a `.cha` file containing child language data.
2. Right-click in the editor and choose **Run KidEval**, or use the
   Command Palette: **TalkBank: Run KidEval**.
3. The KidEval panel opens with characteristic selection controls.

### Step 1: Select language and activity

The panel presents two cascading dropdowns:

- **Language** — choose the child's language (English NA, English UK,
  French, Japanese, Spanish, Chinese, Dutch, Cantonese)
- **Activity Type** — choose the data collection context (Narrative
  or Toyplay). The activity dropdown filters automatically to show
  only the activities available for the selected language.

If the CHAT file has `@Languages` and `@Types` headers, the panel
**auto-detects** the correct language and activity — no manual
selection needed.

Below the dropdowns, an **availability grid** shows all language ×
activity combinations at a glance. Click any cell to select it:

```
              Narrative    Toyplay
English (NA)   ● 375       ● 3503
English (UK)   ● 540       ● 3459
French         ● 399       ● 627
Japanese       —            ● 167
Spanish        ● 106       ● 936
Chinese        ● 392       ● 1196
Dutch          —            —       *
Cantonese      —            —       *

● = available with sample count
— = not available
* = general database (not activity-specific)
```

When a language + activity is selected, a **matching database card**
appears showing the database filename, sample count, and metadata.

The activity type matters: narrative tasks (story retelling, picture
description) and toy play sessions elicit different language patterns.
Use the database that matches your data collection protocol.

### Step 2: Filter by age and gender

After selecting language and activity, you can optionally narrow the
comparison group:

- **Gender** — filter to Male, Female, or All
- **Age range** — enter minimum and maximum age in months to compare
  against children within a specific developmental window

Leave these fields blank to compare against the full normative sample.

### Available KidEval databases

| Language | Activity | Database | Samples |
|----------|----------|----------|--------:|
| English (NA) | Narrative | `eng_narrative_db.cut` | 375 |
| English (NA) | Toyplay | `eng_toyplay_db.cut` | 3,503 |
| English (UK) | Narrative | `engu_narrative_db.cut` | 540 |
| English (UK) | Toyplay | `engu_toyplay_db.cut` | 3,459 |
| French | Narrative | `fra_narrative_db.cut` | 399 |
| French | Toyplay | `fra_toyplay_db.cut` | 627 |
| Japanese | Toyplay | `jpn_toyplay_db.cut` | 167 |
| Spanish | Narrative | `spa_narrative_db.cut` | 106 |
| Spanish | Toyplay | `spa_toyplay_db.cut` | 936 |
| Chinese | Narrative | `zho_narrative_db.cut` | 392 |
| Chinese | Toyplay | `zho_toyplay_db.cut` | 1,196 |
| Dutch | General | `nld.cut` | 121 |
| Cantonese | General | `yue.cut` | 49 |

### Step 3: View results

Click **Run** to compute the analysis. Results appear in three sections:

**Stat cards** at the top of the panel show the key measures with
color-coded z-score indicators:

- Green: within 1 standard deviation of the mean (typical range)
- Yellow: between 1 and 2 standard deviations (borderline)
- Red: more than 2 standard deviations from the mean (atypical)

> *Capture this: KidEval results after clicking "Compare with Database" for an English narrative file, showing colored stat cards (green/red z-scores) and the detailed comparison table with Measure, Child, Norm Mean, Norm SD, z-score, N columns.*

**Comparison table** showing side-by-side values:

| Measure | Child | Norm Mean | Norm SD | z-score |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| MLU | 3.21 | 3.85 | 0.62 | -1.03 |
| MLT | 1.45 | 1.80 | 0.35 | -1.00 |
| VOCD | 42.3 | 55.1 | 12.4 | -1.03 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Per-measure breakdown** with additional detail for each metric.

### What each measure means

| Measure | What it captures |
|---------|-----------------|
| MLU | Utterance length in morphemes (grammatical complexity) |
| MLT | Utterances per turn (conversational participation) |
| VOCD | Vocabulary diversity (D statistic) |
| DSS | Developmental Sentence Score (grammatical maturity) |
| IPSyn | Index of Productive Syntax (structural range) |
| Total words | Overall productivity |
| Total utterances | Sample size |
| TTR | Type-token ratio (raw vocabulary breadth) |

For detailed explanations of each measure, see
[Profiling Commands](profiling.md).

## Eval -- General Language Assessment

Eval uses the same panel interface as KidEval but with databases
designed for adult or general language assessment rather than child
development norms.

### How to run Eval

1. Open a `.cha` file in the editor.
2. Right-click and choose **Run Eval**, or use the Command Palette:
   **TalkBank: Run Eval**.
3. Select a database, optionally filter, and click **Run**.

### Available Eval databases

| Database file | Language | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `eng_eval_db.cut` | American English | General adult language norms |
| `fra_eval_db.cut` | French | General adult language norms |

Eval databases contain normative data from healthy adult speakers,
useful as a baseline for comparing clinical populations.

## Eval-D -- Dementia Assessment

Eval-D is a specialized assessment mode for evaluating language in
dementia contexts. It uses normative databases from DementiaBank.

### How to run Eval-D

1. Open a `.cha` file in the editor.
2. Right-click and choose **Run Eval-D (Dementia)**, or use the Command
   Palette: **TalkBank: Run Eval-D (Dementia)**.
3. Select a database and click **Run**.

### Available Eval-D databases

| Database file | Language | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `eng_eval-d_db.cut` | American English | DementiaBank norms (MCI, Possible AD, Probable AD, Vascular, Control) |
| `engu_eval-d_db.cut` | British English | DementiaBank norms (UK) |

Eval-D results use the same panel layout as KidEval and Eval:
stat cards with z-scores, comparison table, and per-measure breakdown.
The normative groups include control participants and multiple dementia
subtypes, allowing clinicians to see where a patient falls relative to
each group.

## Exporting assessment results

All three assessment tools support CSV export:

1. After results are displayed, click **Export CSV** in the panel toolbar.
2. Choose a save location.
3. The CSV includes all stat card values, z-scores, and the full
   comparison table.

This is useful for:
- Importing results into a clinical report template
- Longitudinal tracking (export at each visit, combine in a spreadsheet)
- Research data collection across multiple participants

## Choosing the right assessment tool

| Population | Tool | Database to use |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Children (English, narrative task) | KidEval | `eng_narrative_db.cut` |
| Children (English, toy play) | KidEval | `eng_toyplay_db.cut` |
| Children (other languages) | KidEval | Language-specific database |
| Healthy adults (baseline) | Eval | `eng_eval_db.cut` or `fra_eval_db.cut` |
| Adults with suspected dementia | Eval-D | `eng_eval-d_db.cut` |
| Adults with aphasia | Eval | `eng_eval_db.cut` (compare against healthy norms) |
