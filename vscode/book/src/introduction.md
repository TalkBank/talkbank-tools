**Last updated:** 2026-03-30 13:40 EDT

The TalkBank CHAT Editor is a VS Code extension for working with
[CHAT format](https://talkbank.org/0info/manuals/CHAT.html) transcripts.
It replaces the legacy CLAN macOS application with a modern, cross-platform
editor backed by a Rust language server.

## What it does

- **Real-time validation** — errors appear as you type, with quick fixes
- **33 CLAN analysis commands** — FREQ, MLU, DSS, KidEval, and more
- **Media playback** — click a bullet to play audio, waveform visualization
- **Transcription mode** — F4 bullet stamping with live audio
- **Review mode** — rate and correct alignment quality with keyboard shortcuts
- **Dependency graphs** — visualize grammatical relations
- **Cross-tier alignment** — click a word, see its morphology and timing
- **Coder mode** — structured annotation with `.cut` code files
