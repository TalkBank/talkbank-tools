# Corpus Validation

**Last updated:** 2026-03-30 13:40 EDT

The Validation Explorer provides corpus-scale validation of `.cha` files directly within VS Code. Unlike CLAN, which validates one file at a time, the extension can check entire directory trees and display all errors in a navigable tree view.

## Validation Explorer

The **CHAT Validation** panel appears automatically in the Explorer sidebar when the extension is active. It mirrors your workspace folder structure, filtered to show only `.cha` files and the directories that contain them.

> *Capture this: Open a workspace with multiple .cha files, validate all, and show the tree with green checkmarks on passing files, red X badges with error counts on failing files, and expanded error items under a failing file*

## Validating Files

### Single File

Click the checkmark icon next to any `.cha` file in the Validation Explorer tree. The file is validated and its status updates:

- **Green checkmark** -- the file is valid CHAT
- **Red X with error count** (e.g., "3 errors") -- the file has validation errors

### Directory

Click the double-checkmark icon next to a folder to validate all `.cha` files in that directory and its subdirectories. This runs the `chatter validate` CLI with `--format json` under the hood, using parallel workers for speed.

### Entire Workspace

Click the double-checkmark button in the Validation Explorer toolbar to validate every `.cha` file in the workspace.

## Navigating Errors

When a file fails validation, expand it in the tree to see individual error items. Each error shows:

- The error code (e.g., E301, E501)
- A description of the problem
- The line number

Click on any error item to jump directly to the exact line and column in the editor. The editor opens the file if it is not already open.

## Toolbar

The Validation Explorer toolbar provides two actions:

| Button | Icon | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| Validate All | Double-checkmark | Validate all `.cha` files in the workspace |
| Refresh | Refresh | Update the tree view to reflect filesystem changes |

## Context Menu

Right-click on files or directories in the Validation Explorer for additional options:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Validate File** | Validate a single `.cha` file |
| **Validate Directory** | Validate all `.cha` files in a folder |
| **Clear Cache** | Remove cached validation results, forcing revalidation |

## How It Works

The Validation Explorer does **not** use the LSP for bulk validation. Instead, it shells out to the `chatter validate` CLI with `--format json`, parses the JSON output, and builds the tree view from the results. This design allows it to validate entire directories without loading every file into the LSP, and it benefits from the CLI's parallel validation workers (via crossbeam).

Results are cached in a SQLite database so that repeated views of the same files are instant. See [Cache Management](../configuration/cache.md) for details on the cache location and how to clear it.

## Real-Time vs. Bulk Validation

The extension provides two complementary validation paths:

| Path | Trigger | Scope | Speed |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Real-time (LSP)** | Typing in the editor | Single open file | Instant (250ms debounce) |
| **Bulk (CLI)** | Validation Explorer | Entire directories | Parallel, cached |

Real-time validation shows errors as inline squiggles and in the Problems panel as you edit. Bulk validation via the Validation Explorer gives you a corpus-wide overview. Both use the same underlying validation logic.
