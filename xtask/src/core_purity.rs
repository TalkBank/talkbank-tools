//! The gate that keeps `batchalign-core` pure.
//!
//! `batchalign-core` is defined by what it CANNOT reach: no async runtime, no
//! filesystem, no subprocess, no socket, no ambient environment, no SQL, no
//! Python bridge. That definition is what makes a task runner testable against a
//! mock dispatcher instead of a GPU, a model download and a jobs database, and
//! it is the whole reason the crate is being extracted.
//!
//! Nothing in the language expresses it. `#![forbid(...)]` works on lints, not
//! on capabilities, so one `axum = { workspace = true }` added in good faith
//! eighteen months from now ends the property with every test still green. This
//! gate is the only mechanism that states it, and it runs in `make lint` and CI.
//!
//! # Two halves, because one instrument cannot see both kinds of violation
//!
//! 1. **The dependency half** walks `cargo tree` for crates that hand core a
//!    capability wholesale: an HTTP server, an HTTP client, SQL, pyo3, a foreign
//!    executor. Transitive acquisition is the case it exists for, and a tree
//!    walk is the only thing that sees it.
//! 2. **The source half** greps core's own `src/` for the runtime, std-I/O and
//!    ambient-environment surface: `tokio::spawn`, `std::fs`, `std::process`,
//!    `std::net`, `std::env`. These need no dependency of their own, so nothing
//!    in the tree betrays them.
//!
//! # WHY the tokio question is answered in the source half and not the tree half
//!
//! This is the trap that made the first version of this gate wrong, so it is
//! written down rather than left to be rediscovered.
//!
//! Core is meant to allow `tokio::sync` (its channels and locks are
//! executor-agnostic and pull in no scheduler) while forbidding the scheduler
//! itself. The obvious implementation is to let `tokio` appear in the tree and
//! check its enabled FEATURES. **It does not work here.** Measured on this
//! workspace: with `crates/batchalign-core` declaring
//! `tokio = { features = ["sync"] }` and nothing else, `cargo tree -p
//! batchalign-core -e normal` reported tokio with
//! `full,rt,rt-multi-thread,macros,time,fs,net,process,...` and pulled `mio` in
//! underneath it.
//!
//! The cause is Cargo's feature unification: `-p` selects the ROOT of the
//! printed tree, not an independent resolution, so every feature any other
//! workspace member turns on is present. `batchalign` enables tokio's `full`,
//! therefore so does core.
//!
//! And this is not merely a reporting artifact. Unification is what actually
//! gets compiled, so core would link a tokio that HAS `rt` in it, and
//! `tokio::spawn` written inside core would compile. A manifest-level feature
//! restriction cannot enforce purity inside one workspace at all. Hence:
//! `tokio` is not in the forbidden package set, `mio` is not either (it is
//! reachable only through unification), and the scheduler is caught by the
//! source markers, which unification cannot touch.
//!
//! # Scope, stated so the next reader does not over-trust it
//!
//! - `-e normal` excludes dev- and build-dependencies deliberately. A test
//!   wanting `#[tokio::test]` does not compromise the shipped library.
//! - The source half scans `src/` only. A test that genuinely needs an executor
//!   is not testing pure logic, so it belongs in `tests/` (an integration test
//!   linking the built lib, free to use any dev-dependency) or in the engine
//!   crate. `#[tokio::test]` is allowed inline as the one common exception.
//! - Only WHOLE-LINE comments are stripped before matching. A trailing `//` is
//!   left in place because stripping it correctly means knowing whether the
//!   slashes are inside a string literal, and guessing there would silently
//!   blind the scan. Consequence: a marker mentioned in a trailing comment is a
//!   violation, and the fix is to move the prose onto its own line. Whole-line
//!   stripping is not optional: this crate's own `lib.rs` names `std::fs` and
//!   `tokio::spawn` in its module doc while containing neither.
