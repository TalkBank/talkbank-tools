//! Scans all `.rs` files under the audit roots for structs with ≥10
//! named fields and ensures each is registered in `WIDE_STRUCT_ALLOWANCES`
//! with a reviewed field cap and classification.
//!
//! Run it with `cargo run -q -p xtask -- lint-wide-structs`. It is wired into
//! `make ci-local` and `make batchalign-ci-rust`, so CI fails on drift.
